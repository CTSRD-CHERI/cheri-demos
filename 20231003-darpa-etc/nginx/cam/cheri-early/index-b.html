<h1>
  BERI/CHERI early adopters website
</h1>

<p>
This website provides information, hardware designs, and software for
early-access users of the <a href="../beri.html">BERI microprocessor</a> and
its <a href="../cheri.html">CHERI ISA extensions</a>.
This includes architecture, platform reference, and user guides, FPGA bitfiles
to be flashed onto development boards, and software images necessary to
exercise and experiment with BERI and CHERI.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.csl.sri.com">SRI International</a> and the <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a> are able to
provide only limited support for externel BERI/CHERI deployment.
However, we encourage you to contact us if any issues are encountered, and we
will work to support a growing user community as resources permit.
</p>

<h2>WARNING</h2>

<p>
BERI/CHERI and its software are highly experimental; early adopters are warned
that correct operation is unlikely (despite the best of intentions by its
developers).
Further, BERI units may interfere with other devices on the network, and have
done so in the past, due to use of experimental network features, device
driver bugs, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Users may wish to employ caution when deploying BERI devices in production
network environments, and will ideally place them behind existing firewalls.
It is also possible (and in fact, fairly easy) to cause permanent damage to
FPGA development boards -- e.g., by damaging the on-board flash (etc), which
is an expensive scenario best avoided.
</p>

<h2>Current releases</h2>

<p>
If you have previously downloaded our Annabella and Ambrunes 2013 early
releases as part of the DARPA CRASH programme, you can find them <a

<dl>
<dt><a href="20140814-release.html">13 August 2014 - CHERI bitfile
  update</a></dt>
<dd>
  This bitfile update is replaces the Ambrunes bitfile previously made
  available to CHERI early adopters in the DARPA CRASH and MRC research
  programmes.</dd>

<dt><a href="20140313-release.html">13 March 2014 - BERI/CHERI source
  code</a></dt>
<dd>This is the first BERI/CHERI source-code release, including both Bluespec
  source code for the BERI1/BERI2 processors, supporting Bluespec libraries,
  and C-language simulation libraries and tools.
  It corresponds roughly to our 1 March 2014 BERI test suite release, and
  5 March 2014 documentation release.</dd>

<dt><a href="20140305-release.html">5 March 2014 - Documentation
  updates</a></dt>
<dd>Updates to the <i>BERI Hardware Reference</i>, <i>BERI Software
  Reference</i>, <i>CHERI Architecture Document</i>, <i>CHERI User's
  Guide</i>, and <i>CHERI Documentation Roadmap</i> to reflect changes since
  the March 2013 drops of the same documents.</dd>

<dt><a href="20140301-release.html">1 March 2014 - BERI Test Suite 1.1</a></dt>
<dd>This is our second release of the CHERI Test Suite, which is used to
  validate MIPS and CHERI ISA instruction-level behaviour in BERI.</dd>
