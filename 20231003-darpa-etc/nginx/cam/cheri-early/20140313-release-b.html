<h1>
  First BERI/CHERI source-code release for early adopters (20140313)
</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This is our first "early adopter" BERI/CHERI source-code release, which
includes Bluespec source code for the BERI1/BERI2 processors, supporting
Bluespec libraries, as well as C-language simulation components and tools
(E.g., berictl which communicates with the BERI debug unit).
These releases correspond roughly to the 1 March 2014 release of the BERI test
suite, and 5 March 2014 release of BERI/CHERI documentation.
The documentation drop includes instructions for building and simulating the
processors, as well as building corresponding CHERI SDK and FreeBSD/CheriBSD
operating-system images.
</p>

<p>
These drops have been prepared with the intent that they support
Bluespec-based simulation outside of the SRI/Cambridge development
environment for the first time; they may also be useful for hardware
synthesis targets, although we are not yet able to distribute the Altera
Quartus project files and some related components which will make building
our demonstration tablet environment easier.
Currently, our build files and scripts for simulation include assumptions
about our development environment that will likely not hold true elsewhere; as
these are discovered, please let us know and we can help resolve them.
As this is a first release, we expect that the road may be somewhat bumpy for
early adopters -- please do e-mail the CHERI early adopters' mailing list, or
us directly, if you encounter difficulties.
