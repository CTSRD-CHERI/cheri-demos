<p>
Clean Slate Trustworthy Secure Research and Development (CTSRD - pronounced "custard") is a joint research project between <a href="http://www.csl.sri.com/">SRI
International's Computer Science Laboratory</a> and the <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge Computer
Laboratory</a>, supported by DARPA (part of the DARPA CRASH, MRC, and SSITH
programmes), Google, and Arm.
The project is revisiting the hardware-software security interface for
general-purpose CPUs to fundamentally improve security; to this end, we are
integrating a hybrid capability model and continuous hardware-assisted
validation of security design principles with a commodity CPU ISA and open
source operating systems.
We are pursuing several new software/hardware features as part of this
research:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="beri/">BERI: a open-source hardware-software research and
  teaching platform</a>: a 64-bit RISC processor implemented in the high-level
  Bluespec hardware description language (HDL), along with compiler, operating
  system, and applications;</li>

<li><a href="cheri/">CHERI: capability hardware enhanced RISC
  instructions </a>: hardware-accelerated in-process memory protection and
  sandboxing model based on a hybrid capability model;</li>

<li><a href="tesla/">TESLA: temporally enforced security logic assertions</a>:
  compiler-generated runtime instrumentation continuously validating temporal
  security properties;</li>

<li><a href="soaap.html">SOAAP: security-oriented analysis of application
  programs</a>: automated program analysis and transformation techniques to
  help software authors utilize <a
  href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/">Capsicum</a> and
  CHERI features; and</li>

<li><a href="smten.html">Smten: SMT-based tools</a> to support the formal
  verification of processor designs implemented in Bluespec.
</ul>

<p>
There is a strong interest, throughout, in judiciously applying formal
methodology and bringing formally grounded techniques to mainstream hardware
and software development.
This work has motivated the creation of the <a href="beri/">Bluespec
extensible RISC implementation</a> &ndash; an open-source platform for research
into the hardware-software interface, with a BSD-licensed operating system and
toolchain based on FreeBSD and Clang/LLVM.
We are using open source, wherever possible, to transition new technologies
into mainstream use.
</p>

<p>
CTSRD builds on long past experience at both institutions in security and
systems research, including Multics, PSOS, the Newcastle DSS, separation
kernels, the DARPA CHATS programme, PVS/SAL/YICES, LynuxWorks, the CAP
computer, the MAC Framework, multi-threaded CPU design, Xen, Capsicum, and
MirageOS.
