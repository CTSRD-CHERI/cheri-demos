<h1>
  CHERI Software Compartmentalization
</h1>
<p>
  The <a href=".">CHERI protection model</a> provides a set of low-level
  primitives that enable scalable, fine-grained software compartmentalization.
  These primitives can be used to implement a variety of software-layer models
  pursuing different <i>software operational models</i>
  We have implemented multiple prototypes of potential models, including the
  following, which are implemented in our <a href="cheribsd.html"><b>CheriBSD
  operating system</b></a>.
  <b>Note that these are experimental prototypes, and are not yet believed to
  provide strong containment.</b>
</p>

<h2>Colocated processes (co-processes)</h2>
<p>
  In this model, multiple UNIX processes run <i>colocated</i> within a single
  virtual address space, separated by CHERI rather than using multiple
  MMU page tables.
  CHERI enables faster process switching through exception-free,
  capability-based and higher bandwidth communication
  channels; in early FPGA-based measurements, we have seen 1-2 orders of
  magnitude improvements.
  Coprocesses inherit the integrity, confidentiality, and availability
  properties of the UNIX process model.
  This model requires eliminating fork() to create colocated processes, which
  interacts with the common zygote performance optimization for sandboxed
  programs.
  There is an initial prototype of this model in a CheriBSD development
  branch, which runs on the CHERI-RISC-V architecture.
  A port to the Morello architecture is in progress.
</p>

<h2>Compartmentalized shared libraries</h2>
<p>
  In this model, a compartmentalizing run-time linker constraints arbitrary
  code execution within shared libraries to linkage declared in ELF, as well
  as any policy constraints on linkage.
  Compartmentalized shared libraries have strong confidentality and integrity
  properties, but not additional availability properties.
  An initial prototype of this model shipped in CheriBSD 22.12, and runs on
  the Morello architecture.
  We plan to also develop support for the CHERI-RISC-V architecture.
