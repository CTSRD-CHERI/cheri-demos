<h1>SOSP 2023 - CHERI Workshop</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Join us on 23 October 2023 for a taste of CHERI at SOSP. We will guide curious
software engineers through a series of hands-on, canned, and yet hopefully fun
and informative exercises exploring various aspects of CHERI's impact on
architecture and software, with short presentations and opportunity for
discussion for each.</p>

<!--
<p>(At the present moment the <a
href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nwf20/cheri-exercises-book">exercises</a> are
in a draft state; you are welcome to look at our work in progress, but things should
be much more polished in a week. The slide deck used during the tutorial will
also be made available for download the day of the tutorial.)</p>
-->

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Should you wish to work through the exercises with us on the day of,
everything will likely go much more smoothly if you have done a very little bit
of "homework" to prepare a CHERI environment ahead of time. Specifically,
please either download and install the <a
href="https://cheri-dist.cl.cam.ac.uk/">CheriBSD software release</a> (which
requires the use of an x86-64 machine MacOS or Linux machine and docker) or
follow <a
href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nwf20/cheri-exercises-book/introduction/get.html#source">the
DIY installation instructions</a>. For this tutorial, we will be using the
CheriBSD/RISC-V software stack. With that installed, you should be able to
complete the first exercise, <a
href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nwf20/cheri-exercises-book/exercises/compile-and-run/index.html">Compile
and run baseline and CHERI-enabled programs</a>, which walks you through
compiling and running a program in the emulated CHERI environment. If you
encounter difficulties, please do reach out to us on the <a
href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/cheri-slack.html">CHERI-CPU
Slack</a> or on <a
href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/sympa/info/cl-cheri-discuss">the Cambridge
Computer Lab CHERI discussion email list</a>. That's it; though, of course, you
are welcome to read further ahead in the book, if you like.</p>

<h2>Agenda</h2>

<p>The tutorial will begin at 10:30 AM and is likely to
go until 6 PM, with a lunch break and a coffee break in the afternoon.
We will also support remote attendees if there is interest.</p>

<p>We will open with a short slideware overview of CHERI, and the bulk of the
day will be spent on the exercises, exploring CHERI's implications,
including:</p>

<ul>

<li> Changes to the ISA and program <code>.text</code></li>

<li> Spatially safe C, including detailed looks at stack, global, and heap
spatial safety</li>

<li>Source-level changes required by CHERI C</li>

<li>CHERI's impact on (C) compilers and linkers</li>

<li>The CheriABI *nix system call interface</li>

</ul>

<p>For each exercise, we intend 15-20 minutes of work and investigation
followed by another 15-20 minutes of presentation reviewing the lessons
learned. Time permitting, we will also present a few 20-to-30-minute, deep dives
into additional topics and ongoing research projects at the University of
Cambridge, SRI, and Microsoft Research Cambridge.</p>
