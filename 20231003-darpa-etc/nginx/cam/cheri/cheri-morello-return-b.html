<h1>
  Arm Morello return programme
</h1>

<p>
The <a href="cheri-morello.html"><b>Arm Morello</b></a> board, produced as
part of the UKRI <a href="dsbd.html"><b>Digital Security by Design</b></a>
programme, is a prototype CHERI-enabled Arm board distributed to UK research
labs, universities, and companies, as well as other interested parties,
starting in 2021.
There is significant demand for Morello boards, which are part of a limited
production run, and as some board recipients wrap up projects, it is possible
to return boards for reuse by others.
The University of Cambridge operates an Arm Morello Return Programme,
receiving boards and helping to find new homes for them.
For example, they might be used to replace failed boards across the dozens of
companies and universities participating in DSbD, used in Cambridge as part of
our remote-access Morello cluster, or be loaned to other organisations
spinning up new research projects or working on open source for Morello.
It is not yet clear how many boards will be returned via this programme, and
the procedures we follow, and distribution strategies we pursue, will depend
on the actual number of boards we receive.

<h1>Return procedure</h1>

<p>
Cambridge requests that you contact us via email <a
href="mailto:morello-returns@cl.cam.ac.uk"><b>morello-returns@cl.cam.ac.uk</b></a>
to arrange a board return, and we will provide shipping directions and other
preparation information.
</p>

<p>
We request that your remove any proprietary, personally identifying (e.g.,
protected by GDPR), or otherwise sensitive data from your Morello system
before shipping.
You can blank any disks in the machine, or remove the disks and let us know
that we will need to replace them before the board can be reused.
We will assume that you have completed the removal of any data before we
receive the board.
</p>

<p>
If possible, we would appreciate your using the original Arm packing material
to ship the box back, and that you insure the box suitably, as we cannot take
any responsibility for damage in shipping.
</p>

<p>
On receiving the board, we will perform some basic validation that it works,
ensure it has the latest firmware, and then look to allocate the board for
reuse.
