<h2 id="cheri">What is CHERI?</h2>

<p>
<a href="."><b>CHERI<b></a> is a hardware-software protection model extending
contemporay ISAs with support for fine-grained capabilities.
CHERI enables fine-grained memory protection and scalable
compartmentalization.
Our early CHERI prototypes were based on the 64-bit MIPS ISA; more recently
our research has been on <a href="cheri-risc-v.html"><b>32-bit and 64-bit
RISC-V</b></a>.
We have created multiple CHERI prototypes on FPGA using various
microarchitectures, and also created a complete <a
href="cheri-software.html"><b>open-source CHERI software stack</b></a>.
This includes our <a href="cheri-llvm.html"><b>CHERI Clang/LLVM/LLD
toolchain</b></a> and CHERI GDB debugger, and our CHERI-enabled adaptation of
the FreeBSD operating system, <a href="cheribsd.html"><b>CheriBSD</b></a>, and
demonstration applications such as nginx, OpenSSH, and WebKit.
Our technical report <a
href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-941.pdf"><b>An
Introduction to CHERI</b></a> is a high-level summary of our work on CHERI
architecture, microarchitecture, formal modeling, and software.
</p>

<h2 id="morello">What is Morello?</h2>

<p>
<a href="cheri-morello.html"><b>Arm's Morello</b></a> is a multi-Ghz,
multi-core experimental CHERI-extended ARMv8-A CPU, System-on-Chip (SoC), and
board.
Morello has been created at part of UKRI's Digital Security by Design (DSbD)
research programme as a collaboration between Arm and the University of
Cambridge.
We provide a full adapation of our CHERI software stack to Morello.
</p>

<h2 id="software">CHERI software releases for Morello</h2>

<p>
The Arm Morello FVP model was released on 29 October 2020, and we have
provided an initial <a href="https://cheri-dist.cl.cam.ac.uk/"><b>CheriBSD
Morello Developer Preview</b></a>.
We aim to release further quarterly updates to CheriBSD and its application
stack roughly quarterly.
Our release plans and feature goals for CheriBSD/Morello are as follows:

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting started with the CHERI software stack on Morello</h2>

<p>
The CHERI software stack for Morello consists of:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>CheriBSD/Morello operating system and applications</li>
  <li>Arm's adaptation of the CHERI Clang/LLVM/LLD GDB toolsuite for Morello,
    bundled as an SDK with cross-build and cross-debug from FreeBSD, Linux,
    and macOS</li>
  <li>Docker development environment providing cross-compiler, cross-debugger,
    and target libraries for CheriBSD/Morello.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Visit our <a href="https://cheri-dist.cl.cam.ac.uk"><b>CheriBSD distribution
  site</b></a> to get stated.
</p>

<h2 id="webkit">CHERI-WebKit on Morello</h2>

<p>
In collaboration with Arm, we have developed a port of the
<a href="cheri-webkit.html"><b>WebKit</b></a> browser engine for Morello.
Support so far includes multiple optimization tiers of WebKit's JavaScript
runtime, including the baseline JIT compiler. This work will facilitate
measurements of CHERI's performance impact and security properties for a
modern virtual machine.
