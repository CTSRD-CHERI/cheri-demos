<h1>CheriBSD</h1>

<p>
  CheriBSD is an adaptation of the open-source FreeBSD operating system to
  support CHERI-RISC-Vand Arm Morello in emulation and on hardware.
  We have used CheriBSD to validate a number of hypotheses about the CHERI
  capability model, including hybridization between MMU-based virtual memory
  and the in-address-space CHERI capability model, and also C-language
  hybridization.
  CheriBSD provides a highly functional operating-system prototype that
  demonstrates how fine-grained memory protection can be composed with a
  conventional OS design.
</p>

<p>
  The CheriBSD kernel and userspace both support pure-capability CHERI C/C++:
  they can be compiled to implement strong capability-based referential and
  spatial memory protection.
  This includes continuous validation of pointer provenance, pointer bounds
  checking on code, the heap, the stack, and global variables, as well as
  pointer permission checking.
  The kernel has been extended to implement tag support in virtual memory,
  capability context switching, and various capability-extended interfaces
  including debugging.
  Our memory-safe userspace process environment is known as CheriABI, and
  extends the system-call and other ABIs to implement pointers as capabilities
  universally, rather than using an integer type.
  A prototype branch implements userspace heap temporal memory safety using
  capability revocation; we aim to merge this to the CheriBSD main development
  branch in early 2022.
  We also have several in-progress prototypes of scalable userspace software
  compartmentalization based on different software operational models, which
  should mature over the course of 2022.

<h2 id="cheribsd-resources">CheriBSD resources</h2>

<p>
  The main resource for CheriBSD is the <a
  href="https://cheribsd.org/"><b>CheriBSD website</b></a> where you can
  download source code and pre-built releases, and also find documentation and
  support.
</p>

<p>
  The document <a
  href="https://ctsrd-cheri.github.io/cheribsd-getting-started/cover/index.html"><b>Getting
  Started with CheriBSD</b></a> guide provides step-by-step installation
  instructions for Morello boards, gets you up and running with a CHERI-enabled
  "hello world", and provides support information for CheriBSD.
</p>

<h2>Building and running CheriBSD</h2>

<p>
  CheriBSD can be cross compiled from x86 development workstations/servers and
  booted on our <a href="cheri-risc-v.html#cores">FPGA 64-bit CHERI-RISC-V ISA
  soft-core processors</a>, on <a href="cheri-qemu.html">QEMU-CHERI</a>, an
  ISA-level emulation of the CHERI-RISC-V and Morello instruction sets and on
  an <a href="cheri-morello.html">Arm Morello board</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The best way to build and run CheriBSD on CHERI-RISC-V or Morello is using
  our <a
  href="https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribuild"><b>cheribuild</b></a> tool.
  cheribuild will download any necessary source code, build our
  cross-development environment, the OS itself, and any necessary emulators,
  create disk images, and run the emulation tool.
  For CHERI-RISC-V and Morello, that's <a
  href="cheri-qemu.html"><b>QEMU-CHERI</b></a>.
  For Morello, you can also choose <a
  href="https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/arm-platforms-software/arm-ecosystem-fvps"><b>Arm's
  Morello FVP model</b></a>, which cheribuild will download automatically if
  using run-fvp-morello-purecap in place of the target below.
  If you have a Morello board, see <a href="#cheribsd-resources">CheriBSD
  resources</a> above for details about installing pre-built releases.
</p>

<p>
  Get started with emulating CheriBSD/CHERI-RISC-V in one command line:
</p>

<pre>
./cheribuild.py --include-dependencies run-riscv64-purecap
</pre>

<p>
  Get started with emulating CheriBSD/Morello in one command line:
</p>

<pre>
./cheribuild.py --include-dependencies run-morello-purecap
</pre>
  
<p>
  By default images created by cheribuild can be logged into as root with no
  password.
</p>

<p>
  The CheriBSD prototype can be found in the <a
  href="https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribsd">CheriBSD GitHub
  repository</a>.
  We also use a GitHub issue tracker to track <a
  href="https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribsd/issues">bugs and feature
  requests for CheriBSD</a>.
</p>

<h2>Papers and documentation</h2>

<p>
  CheriBSD was used as the foundation OS for our various publications at
  ISCA 2014, ASPLOS 2015, IEEE S&amp;P 2015, ASPLOS 2019, and Oakland
  2020 papers on CHERI memory protection, which can be found on the <a
  href="cheri-publications.html"><b>CHERI publications list</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
  Our paper on <a
  href="../pdfs/201904-asplos-cheriabi.pdf"><b>CheriABI</b></a> explains
  CheriBSD's memory-safe process environment.
  The <a
  href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-947.pdf"><b>CHERI
  C/C++ Programming Guide</b></a> introduces the CHERI variants of C and C++
  that run in that process environment.
</p>

<p>
  Implementation and user information can be found on the <a
  href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-877.pdf">CHERI
  Programmer's Guide</a>.
  (Note: This report dates from September 2015; we are currently preparing a
  new version of this report to be released in 2019Q4.)
</p>

<p>
  We have also published papers in open-source venues such as BSDCan,
  AsiaBSDCon, and FreeBSD Journal on how we built and support a long-running
  derivative research operating system based on FreeBSD.
</p>

<h2>Open-source research methodology</h2>
<p>
  Our complete CHERI software stack including compiler and operating-system
  prototype are developed as open source.
  We are committed to upstreaming pertinent improvements to FreeBSD where
  sensible, and have already done so for support of the <a
  href="../beri/">BERI soft-core processor and peripherals</a>, general
  improvements to MIPS and ARMv8-A support, the RISC-V architecture port,
  improvements to Clang/LLVM integration, and many other aspects of the
  open-source OS including QEMU-based ports crossbuilding that we required for
  our research prototype.
