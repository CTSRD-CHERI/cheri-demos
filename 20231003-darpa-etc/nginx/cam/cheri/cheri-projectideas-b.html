<h1>
  Cambridge Part II, Part III, and ACS student project ideas - CHERI
</h1>
<br clear=all>

<div class="ucampas-toc"></div>

<p>
This page documents potential student dissertation and research project ideas
based on CHERI-related research for University of Cambridge Computer
Laboratory students.
As with virtual memory, <a href="."><b>CHERI</b></a> is an <i>architectural
protection model</i>.
CHERI extends Instruction-Set Architectures (ISAs) and processors so that
software can define policies at run time, including memory protection and
isolation.
CHERI has very different scaling properties, and target use cases, from
virtual memory, however, allowing much finer-grained protection and more
efficient software compartmentalisation.
The CHERI project has been running for over ten years, and Arm has recently
shipped an experimental, high-performance CHERI-based CPU, <a
href="cheri-morello.html"><b>Morello</b>, with SoC and development board.
<a
href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/09/06/whats-the-smallest-variety-of-cheri/">Microsoft
has also recently announced a production-quality embedded RISC-V core
implementing CHERI.

Student projects would work on Morello, FPGA, and/or ISA-level simulations
(i.e., <a href="cheri-qemu.html"><b>CHERI Qemu</b></a>), depending on the
project's goals.
Purely software projects might choose to focus solely on Morello, whereas
those investigating architecture or microarchitecture migth use CHERI-RISC-V.
</p>

<h2>CHERI and potential student project foundations in hardware and
  software</h2>
<p>
The CHERI project spans hardware, software, and theory, exploring the
interactions between compatibility, performance, and security as we transform
the way programs are represented in terms of instruction-set architecture,
OS platform, and compilation.
Past Part II projects have included designing a small CHERI-enabled RISC-V
microcontroller, implementing a floating-point unit, adding CHERI-aware
run-time linking to an operating system, and compartmentalising significant
software applications.
Past Partt III and ACS projects have included extending an OS kernel to use
CHERI memory protection internally, testing CHERI integration in the operating
system and compiler using tracing, and extending the DTrace debugging facility
to work with (and use) CHERI.
There are many potential projects to do, in (or spanning) hardware, software,
and formal modeling/proof.
</p>

<p>
Our original CHERI-MIPS hardware stack was based on a home-grown open-source
pipelined 64-bit MIPS core, BERI.
More recently we have been extending a set of three open-source RISC-V cores,
Piccolo (3-stage), Flute (5-stage), and Toooba (superscalar)
implemented in Bluespec SystemVerilog (BSV) based on designs from Bluespec
and MIT.
This new architecture is known as <a
href="cheri-risc-v.html"><b>CHERI-RISC-V</b></a>, and is mature enough to host
a range of research and development projects.
Our CHERI hardware and software could form the basis of other development and
research projects such as exploring potential CHERI interactions with various
computation models such as vector computing and machine learning.
It would also be interesting to explore the composition of CHERI with other
architectural security models such as enclaves, information-flow tracking, and
memory versioning.
</p>

<p>
Our <a href="cheri-software.html"><b>CHERI software stack consists of an
assembler, compiler, and linker based on the Clang/LLVM toolchain</b></a>, as
well as LLD debugger, and two CHERI-extended operating systems: CheriBSD (on
64-bit Armv8-a or 64-bit RISC-V, MMU
based) and CheriFreeRTOS (32-bit RISC-V, without an MMU).
We also have a substantial user application stack, including the FreeBSD UNIX
userspace (e.g., including OpenSSH), and open-source applications such as
Postgres, nginx, Wayland / KDE, and WebKit.
All of these have been extended for fine-grained memory protection; some are
also being extended to support compartmentalisation.
This software stack could be used at the foundation for a variety of
projects including work on new OS primitives (e.g., hypervisor support for
CHERI, analysis tools to validate capability delegation), new
compartmentalisation models such as in-kernel compartments),
compiler features (e.g., exploring CHERI-backed C/C++ type safety not just
memory safety, tradeoffs in terms of bounds setting), debugging (e.g., how
should a debugger work correctly and securely in a least-privilege
environment), or application-level work (how should a major application, such
as a web browser, use compartmentalisation?  How should language runtimes use
architectural memory safety to support higher-level type-safe or managed
languages?).
</p>

<p>
A variety of adversarial activities would also be interesting, to try to
identify vulnerabilities in the architecture, hardware, toolchain, and/or
software stacks.
</p>

<h2>Specific project ideas</h2>

<dl>
<dt><b>CHERI memory and trace analysis for visualisation and
  validation</b></dt>
<dd><p>Contact: Robert Watson</p>
  Memory-safe C and C++ software running on CHERI may instantiate, implicitly
  and implictly, tens or hundreds of thousands of capabilities.
  Tools able to analyse memory snapshot and execution traces could assist both
  with validating that specific implementation objectives are met (e.g., with
  respect to stack or memory-mapping bounds setting, or compartmentalisation),
  and also to support discovering and understanding application behaviour
  (e.g., through static or interactive plots and reports on capability use).

<dt><b>CHERI code generation: From memory safety to type safety</b></dt>
<dd><p>Contact: Robert Watson</p>

  <p>
  Today, the objective of CHERI C/C++, as described in our ASPLOS 2019
  paper on CheriABI, and CHERI C/C++ Programming Guide, is to provide memory
  safety for C.
  This consists of referential safety (pointer protection), spatial safety
  (bounds checking), and temporal safety (pointer revocation), with a set of
  tradeoffs around source-code compatibility, architecture, microarchitecture,
  and protection.
  This disables many common vulnerability classes and attack techniques
  relating to pointer misuse to leak or manipulation data or code.
  However, some attacks against C/C++ rely on type confusion where a pointer
  to one type might be used for another purpose, perhaps leading to
  attacker-manipulable control-flow attacks.
  For example, function pointers with different signatures are not safely
  interchangeable, and yet CHERI will not pick up on that: it distinguishes
  code and data pointers from one another, preventing code-data confusion, but
  not different types of code pointers from each other.
  </p>

  <p>
  There have been a number of research projects on limiting that confusion
  through additional software checks, but none have attempted to use CHERI as
  the enforcement mechanism, which could offer improved efficiency.
  This project would develop a prototype CHERI run-time signature checker for
  function pointers (and perhaps other code pointers), and evaluate against
  the current state-of-the-art (also ported to the same hardware) in terms of
  performance, compatibility, and security.
  One potential approach would be to implement function pointers as sealed
  capabilities, allowing the architecture to run-time type check on
  invocation.
  This could then be extended into more rich types of data-pointer type
  checking, depending on project scope (e.g., if an MPhil project).
  </p>

  <p>
  This project will engage heavily with C-language semantics and practical
  compiler behavior, as well as require building knowledge about a novel
  computer architecture.
  It will be challenging, but should also be very exciting.
  </p></dd>

<dt><b>CHERI stack temporal safety</b></dt>
<dd><p>Contact: Robert Watson</p>

  <p>
  We have explored various forms of heap temporal safety based on
  garbage-collection-like revocation techniques, which sweep memory for
  capabilities to free'd memory before it can be reallocated.
  Due to the current cost and overall throughput of stack allocation, these
  techniques are likely unsuitable for stack allocation.
  This research project would investigate a strawman "true" temporal safety
  for stacks based on revocation, but also a number of more pragmatic
  techniques including stack-frame clearing, performing revocation only on
  escaped pointers and avoiding revocation if no pointers to a frame escape,
  and so on.
  Different gradations of temporal safety would be identified, including
  simple pointer revocation in allocated frames (perhaps via architectural
  fast tag-clearing extensions) through to full memory clearing of frames, and
  full memory revocation.
  Each approach, including the strawman ("ideal semantics") would be
  prototyped via changes to the compiler and C runtime and evaluated on one
  or more CHERI-RISC-V cores (e.g., 5-stage pipeline, superscalar) on FPGA.

<dt><b>Microarchitectural design of new CHERI domain crossing
    instructions</b></dt>
<dd><p>Contact: Jonathan Woodruff</p>

  <p>
  This project would implement the two experimental instructions described in the CHERI Architecture document in the section titled "Indirect Sentry Capabilities" (see CHERI Architecture v8; upcoming publication). This section describes two domain crossing instruction variants for CHERI which should present interesting tradeoffs in microarchitectural implementation. The first loads a capability pointer from memory directly into the PC, and the second not only does this but also loads a second, adjacent capability pointer into a register. This project would implement examples of these instructions in the Flute (in-order, single-scalar) and/or Toooba (out-of-order, super-scalar) open-source CHERI-RISCV implementations and explore the complexity and cost of adding these unusual instructions to the microarchitecture. There should be some evaluation of performance using micro-benchmarks to demonstrate the value (or lack thereof) of the more sophisticated implementation options.
  </p></dd>

<dt><b>CHERI Domain Crossing using Simplified Primitives</b></dt>
<dd><p>Contact: Jonathan Woodruff</p>

  <p>
  The primary domain crossing mechanism for compartmentalisation in CHERI has relied on sealing with object types. The shortcoming of this approach is that it requires a type field to be allocated in the capability encoding which is necessarily limited in size, and therefore introduces an awkward necessity to manage this limited typespace. A simpler mechanism has recently been added to the CHERI architecture; Sealed Entry Capabilities (or "Sentries"). These simply unseal and jump to a target capability, granting access to any capabilities embedded with the target instructions. Sentries have the convenient property that their object type space scales with the virtual address space, while bearing the disadvantage of tying together objects and code.
  </p>

  <p> 
  Libcheri is a library used for compartmentalisation which uses the traditional type-based domain crossing instructions. This project would develop an alternative implementation of libcheri based solely on the Sentry mechanism, likely requiring some system of indirection to ensure the integrity of entry tokens distributed to mutually distrusting domains. This project would seek to approach the performance of type-based libcheri for the existing benchmarks to learn where the type-based mechanism might be replaced for this style of compartmentalisation.
