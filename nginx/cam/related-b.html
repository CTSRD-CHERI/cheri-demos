The CTSRD project builds on a long history of work in computer architecture,
operating systems, programming languages, and security, both at SRI and
Cambridge, and elsewhere.
On this page, we have gathered a few links to recent and ongoing projects that
have been direct influences on our work.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/">Capsicum</a>:
  practical capabilities for UNIX.  Our concerns with the scalability of
  fine-grained application compartmentalisation originated in this work at the
  University of Cambridge, as well as ideas about the hybridisation of
  capability models with contemporary operating system (and CPU) design
  explored further in CHERI.  Reasoning about the correctness of Capsicum also
  led us to aspects of our approach in TESLA.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.openmirage.org/">Mirage</a>.  Developed at the
  University of Cambridge, Mirage is an exokernel for constructing secure,
  high-performance network applications across a variety of cloud computing
  and mobile platforms.  Mirage is based on the OCaml language, with syntax
  extensions and libraires which provide networking, storage, and concurrency
  support.  Mirage can compile fully standalone, specialised microkernels to
  run on Xen, and we hope also to target CHERI.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.xen.org/">Xen</a>.  Developed at the University of
  Cambridge, the Xen hypervisor is widely used in research and industry for
  full-machine virtualisation.  It has been used as a platform for a variety
  of security research, and brings to the forefront limitations of current CPU
  architectures in supporting scalable protection.  We would like to maintain
  full-system virtualisation facilities in CHERI.  Reasoning about Xen's
  correctness will also benefit from TESLA.</li>
</ul>
