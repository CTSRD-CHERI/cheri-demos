<h1>CHERI-RISC-V</h1>

<p>
CHERI-RISC-V is an in-progress application of the CHERI protection model to
the 32-bit and 64-bit variants of the RISC-V Instruction-Set Architecture
(ISA).
The current draft specification of CHERI-RISC-V can be found in <a
href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-951.pdf"><b>CHERI
ISAv8</b></a>, and we are continuing to update the spceification as we improve
the architecture.
We have prototype CHERI-RISC-V implementations of:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Formal Sail specification</li>
  <li>Qemu ISA-level emulator</li>
  <li>3-stage and 5-stage pipelined cores, and a superscalar core, on FPGA</li>
  <li>Adaptation of the CHERI Clang/LLVM/LLD and GDB</li>
  <li>Adaptation of the 32-bit and 64-bit MMU-free CheriFreeRTOS operating
    system, based on FreeRTOS</li>
  <li>Adaptation of the 64-bit MMU-enabled CheriBSD operating system, based on
    FreeBSD</li>
</ul>

<p>
We anticipate an updated <b>CHERI ISAv9</b> in 2021Q3 or 2021Q4 that
introduces a number of improvements relating to code linkage, extended
performance counters for CHERI-related events, and support for compressed
CHERI-RISC-V instructions.
Many of these features are already present in our emulators, hardware, and
software, but instruction and opcode choices are not yet finalized.

<h2 id="isa-hw">CHERI-RISC-V ISA and Implementations</h2>

<h3 id="isa">CHERI-RISC-V Instruction-Set Architecture (ISA)</h3>

<p>
CHERI-RISC-V is a from-scratch application of the CHERI protection model to
the 32-bit and 64-bit variants of the RISC-V ISA.
Our approach learns from experience integrating CHERI into 64-bit MIPS, as
well as <a href="cheri-morello.html"><b>our collaboration with Arm to create
Morello</b></a>, a CHERI extended version of ARMv8-A.
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-951.pdf"><b>CHERI
ISAv8</a> contains a relatively mature prototype of the CHERI-RISC-V ISA, which
we have implemented in multiple microarchitectures and Qemu, and for which we
have complete CHERI Clang/LLVM/LLD/GDB and CheriBSD adaptations.
We expect that future ISA versions will continue to evolve the specification
(and, in particular, opcode encodings, which have not yet been optimized, but
also compressed instructions), and so binary compatibility is not assured.
Key differences between CHERI-MIPS and CHERI-RISC-V include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whereas CHERI-MIPS supported only a split capability register file,
    CHERI-RISC-V supports both merged and split register files.
    Currently, we are focusing on a merged register file.</li>
  <li>CHERI-RISC-V extends 32-bit RISC-V with 64-bit capabilities, and 64-bit
    RISC-V with 128-bit capabilities; CHERI-MIPS supported only 128-bit
    capabilities with 64-bit MIPS.</li>
  <li>CHERI-RISC-V supports hardware floating point.</li>
  <li>CHERI-RISC-V benefits from a richer underlying architecture, including
    architectural page tables.</li>
  <li>CHERI-RISC-V utilizes a new "capability mode" instruction encoding mode
    to conserve ISA opcode space.
    CHERI-RISC-V load and store instructions utilize identical load/store
    encodings, making code generation more similar between baseline RISC-V and
    pure-capability code.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sail">Sail CHERI-RISC-V</h3>

<p>
We have extended the baseline RISC-V Sail model with support for CHERI.
This is our golden model for CHERI-RISC-V, and all pseudocode in our textual
specification is derived from the Sail model.
We use the model for proofs about the architecture (such as that monotonicity
holds), tandem verification, and hope soon to also use it for automated test
generation.
This implementation is experimental:

    CHERI-RISC-V Model (GitHub)</a> - Formal model of the CHERI-RISC-V
    ISA.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="qemu">Qemu CHERI-RISC-V</h3>

<p>
We have extended <a href="cheri-qemu.html">QEMU-CHERI</a> to support CHERI
for 64-bit RISC-V.
This is now incorporated into our mainline QEMU-CHERI implementation, which
can be built using <a
href="https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribuild">cheribuild</a>.
QEMU-CHERI is able to boot and run CheriBSD/RISC-V as well as CheriFreeRTOS.
This implementation is experimental:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/qemu">Qemu-CHERI (GitHub)</a>
    - Qemu-CHERI, which includes support for the CHERI-RISC-V ISA.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cores">CHERI-Piccolo, CHERI-Flute, and CHERI-Toooba CPU cores on
  FPGA</h3>

<p>
We have extended the open-source Bluespec SystemVerilog (BSV) RISC-V cores
Piccolo (32-bit, 3-stage), Flute (64-bit, 5-stage), and Toooba (64-bit,
superscalar) with support for CHERI-RISC-V.
We are developing these cores on the Xilinx VCU-118 board.
These implementations are still highly experimental:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/Piccolo">Piccolo 3-stage core
    (GitHub)</a> - Early prototype running CheriFreeRTOS.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/Flute">Flute 5-stage core
    (GitHib)</a> - Early prototype running CheriBSD/RISC-V and
      CheriFreeRTOS.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/Toooba">Tooba superscalar core
    (GitHub)</a> - Early prototype running CheriBSD/RISC-V.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="software">CHERI-RISC-V Software Stack</h2>

<h3 id="llvm">CHERI Clang/LLVM/LLD on CHERI-RISC-V</h3>

<p>
We have adapted <a href="cheri-llvm.html"><b>CHERI Clang/LLVM and LLD</b></a>,
and GDB to support CHERI-RISC-V.
These changes are part of our mainline CHERI implementations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/llvm-project">CHERI Clang/LLVM
    and LLD main development tree</a> - Supports hybrid and pure-capability
    code generation from CHERI C/C++.
  <li><a href="https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/gdb">CHERI GDB main development
    tree</a> - Supports debugging CHERI-RISC-V CheriABI processes live and
    using core dumps.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cherifreertos">CheriFreeRTOS</h3>

<p>
CheriFreeRTOS is a version of the open-source <a
href="https://www.freertos.org">FreeRTOS embedded operating system</a> that
has been extended to support CHERI memory protection.
CheriFreeRTOS is compiled as a pure-capability binary, and includes strong
hardware-supported spatial memory protection and pointer protection for the
stack, heap, and global variables.
We now have a prototype also supporting software compartmentalization (e.g.,
a sandboxed FreeRTOS TCP/IP stack), but this is not yet ready for more
mainstream use.
</p>

<p><i>GitHub repository to be available shortly.</i></p>

<h3 id="cheribsd">CheriBSD</h3>

<p>
We have extended our existing <a href="cheribsd.html">CheriBSD</a>
implementation with support for CHERI-RISC-V, with the goal of full feature
parity.
CheriBSD is a CHERI-enabled adaptation of the open-source <a
href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/">FreeBSD operating system</a>, along with many
of its applications.
Currently, CheriBSD/RISC-V is experimental, and boots to multiuser mode with a
statically and dynamically linked CheriABI userspace.
These changes are part of our mainline implementation, and CHERI-RISC-V is now
our preferred research platform for software work:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribsd">CheriBSD main
    development tree</a> - Fully supports RISC-V binaries and CheriABI
    binaries.</li>
</ul>
