  The Digital Security by Design (DSbD) Initiative
</h1>

<p>On 22 January 2019, the UK government announced that the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/global-businesses-including-google-and-microsoft-back-uk-to-block-cyber-threats-with-new-tech"><b>UK
  Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund (ISCF) will support the integration of
  new fundamental hardware security through a &#163;70M investment</b></a>, to be
  matched by a further &#163;117M from industry including from Microsoft and
  Google.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.ukri.org/innovation/industrial-strategy-challenge-fund/digital-security-by-design/"><b>ISCF
  Digital Security by Design challenge</b></a> aims to radically update the
  foundation of our insecure digital computing infrastructure, by
  demonstrating that mainstream processor technology (e.g. from Arm) and
  software can be updated to include new security technologies based on the
  <a href="./"><b>CHERI Architecture</b></a>, along with accompanying
  innovations across system software, runtime environments, formal
  verification, and tools from the UK research base and businesses.
  The programme will create a hardware platform prototype in which a
  mainstream processor technology will be updated to include CHERI-like
  security technologies, along with formal modeling and verification of the
  architecture.
  The programme will fund work through the Innovate UK, EPSRC, and ESRC, and
  will support industrial transition and academic research around the
  prototype.</p>

  <p>On 26 September 2019, <a href="https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/calls/iscf-digital-security-by-design-research-projects/"><b>UKRI
  announced a &#163;8M funding call for research into CHERI</b></a> as part of
  Digital Security by Design.
  As part of the program, Arm will produce a demonstrator CPU, SoC, and board
  based on experimental integration of CHERI into the ARMv8-A ISA.
  The boards will be available for industrial and academic research from
  2021.
  Speakers at the Digital Security by Design Collaborators' Workshop in
  London included Robert Watson (University of Cambridge), Richard
  Grisenthwaite (Arm), and Manuel Costa (Microsoft).
  <a href="#cheri-iscf-briefings"><b>Slides and videos from the workshop are
  now online</b></a>.

  </p><p>On 17 October 2019, 
  <a href="https://www.arm.com/blogs/blueprint/digital-security-by-design"><b>Arm
  announced the Morello board</b></a>, an experimental CPU, SoC, and board
integrating CHERI support into an ARMv8-A baseline system.

  Cambridge Security Research Group blog</b></a> provides further background
  on the programme, as well as links to workshop slides and videos regarding
  CHERI and Morello.
  Our <a href="cheri-morello.html"><b>page on Morello</b> provides more detail
  on the forthcoming board.
  The Department of Computer Science and Technology also has a <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/news/cambridge-collaborates-arm-improve-computer-security"><b>blog post on DSbD and Morello</b></a>.</a></p>

<p>This webpage supports the DSbD programme by providing supporting
  information on the CHERI architecture, software stack, and formal models; it
  will be updated frequently over the coming months as further information
  becomes available.
  The CHERI research team is eager to collaborate with academia and industry
  in exploring new potential applications and many unexplored research areas
  for CHERI (e.g., in hypervisors, in language runtimes, with higher-level
  programming languages, in formal verification, and so on).

<h2 id="cheri-architecture">The CHERI architecture</h2>

<p><b>PIs: Robert N. M. Watson (University of Cambridge), Simon W. Moore
  (University of Cambridge), Peter Sewell (University of Cambridge), and Peter
  Neumann (SRI International)</b></p>

  <p>Mainstream computer systems are chronically insecure.
  One of the main reasons for this is that conventional hardware architectures
  and C/C++ language abstractions provide only coarse-grained memory
  protection, which turns many coding errors into exploitable security
  vulnerabilities.
  <a href="./"><b>CHERI is an ongoing research project</b></a>, from 2010 to
  date, that revises the hardware/software architectural interface with
  hardware support for <b>capabilities</b> that can be used for fine-grained
  memory protection and/or scalable software compartmentalisation.
  CHERI aims to provide practically deployable performance and compatibility
  for software, as well as being microarchitecturally viable for mainstream
  architectures and microarchitectures.</p>

  <p>CHERI is a hardware/software/semantics co-design project, combining
  hardware implementation, adaption of mainstream software stacks, and formal
  semantics and proof.
  The CHERI ideas have been developed first as a modification to 64-bit
  MIPS and now also for 32/64-bit RISC-V and 64-bit ARMv8-A.
  We have prototyped a complete software stack for CHERI by adapting widely
  used open-source software such as Clang/LLVM, FreeBSD, FreeRTOS, and
  applications such as WebKit, OpenSSH, and PostgreSQL.
  We have formally modeled the architecture and constructed a number of proofs
  about its security, as well as used these models for microarchitectural
  validation in our prototypes.
  These models also have the potential to support further activities such as
  formal proofs about software and microarchitecture.</p>

  <p>We have <a href="cheri-publications.html"><b>published a number of
  technical reports and papers on the CHERI approach</b></a>, including on the
  instruction set and its design, how efficient microarchitecture can support
  the CHERI model, and how software systems can be adapted to utilize CHERI's
  architectural features.</p>

<p>
  As part of the DARPA-supported work to develop the CHERI Architecture, we
  have adapted a <a href="cheri-software.html"><b>complete open-source
  software stack</b></a> including compiler and toolchain (based on
  Clang/LLVM), general-purpose and embedded operating systems (based on
  FreeBSD and FreeRTOS), and application suite to the architecture (including
  software such as OpenSSH, PostgreSQL, and WebKit).
  This stack is "architecture neutral" in that it can support CHERI extensions
  on multiple architectures, including the original 64-bit MIPS CHERI and also
  more recent work on 32-bit and 64-bit RISC-V CHERI.
  With our industry partners, we anticipate providing a complete adaptation of
  this infrastructure to the hardware platform prototype.</p>

<p>We are currently preparing further technical reports for release in the
  autumn of 2019 in order to support the DSbD programme:</p>

<ul>
<li>A new version of the <b>CHERI Programmer's Guide</b> technical report,
  last released in September 2015.
  The new version will take into account compiler and operating-system
  research since that date, as well as updates to our corresponding software
  prototypes.
  We anticipate this report being released in October 2019.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>More information will be available soon.</i>

<h2 id="research-papers">Research papers on the CHERI Architecture</h2>

<p>Over the past ten years, we have published numerous papers elaborating and
