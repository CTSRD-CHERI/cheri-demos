<h1>The Arm Morello Board</h1>

<p>August 2021: We have released an updated version of our <a
  href="cheri-morello-software.html"><b>CHERI software stack for
  Morello</b></a>, which can be downloaded and run on the Arm Morello FVP
  ISA-level simulator or on QEMU-Morello.  Key features include
  pure-capability kernel support, and integrated support for Morello in our
  main CheriBSD development branch.</p>

<!--
<p>October 2020: We have released a prototype of our <a
  href="cheri-morello-software.html"><b>CHERI software stack for
  Morello</b></a>, which can be downloaded and run on Arm's Morello FVP
  ISA-level simulator.</p>
-->

<p>September 2020: Arm has published its <a
  href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0606/A-f/?lang=en"><b>Morello
  architecture specification</b></a>, a fully elaborated integration of the
  CHERI protection model into the ARMv8-A architecture.</p>

<p>October 2019: <a href="https://www.arm.com/blogs/blueprint/digital-security-by-design"><b>Arm announced Morello</b></a>,
  an experimental CHERI-extended, multicore, superscalar ARMv8-A processor,
  System-on-Chip (SoC), and prototype board to be available from late 2021.
  Morello is a part of the UKRI £187M <a href="dsbd.html"><b>Digital Security
  by Design Challenge</b></a> (DSbD) supported by the UK Industrial Strategy
  Challenge Fund, including a commitment of over £50M commitment by Arm.
  This web page provides more information on Morello, drawing from publicly
  available Arm content, as well as our own material on CHERI.
  You can learn more about CHERI by reading our technical report, <a

  Introduction to CHERI</b></a>.</p>

<h2 id="morello">What is Morello?</h2>

<p>Morello is an industrial demonstrator of a capability architecture: a
  prototype System-on-Chip (SoC) and development board, developed by Arm,
  implementing a CHERI-extended ARMv8-A processor, GPU, peripherals, and
  memory subsystem, to ship in early 2022.
  The purposes of Morello are to enable industrial evaluation of the CHERI
  hardware and software ideas, to gather evidence for adoption, and to support
  further related research and development.
  This will be enabled by applying CHERI to a widely deployed, real-world
  architecture via a high-end mature processor design, and a mature software
  ecosystem.</p>

<p>Morello will be based on Arm's existing <a
  href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13959/arm-announces-neoverse-n1-platform"><b>Neoverse
  N1 platform and CPU</b></a>; this is roughly an Arm A76 with an enhanced
  server-class memory subsystem.
  <a href="https://vimeo.com/366246134/fa067a2689"><b>Richard Grisenthwaite
  (Arm)'s talk</b></a> at the 29 September 2019 ISCF DSbD Collaborators'
  Workshop included the following work-in-progress Morello SoC block
  diagram:</p>

</p>
</a>
</div>
<br>

<p>The Morello SoC includes two CPU clusters, each containing two
  out-of-order cores, all implementing CHERI.
  The Morello SoC has been fabricated in 7nm process, with a target clock
  frequency of 2.5GHz.</p>

<p>The coherent memory interconnect has been extended to carry tag bits, and
  the on-board DRAM controllers supports <a href="#tagging"><b>memory
  tagging</b></a>.
  Other DMA-enabled devices, including the on-SoC Mali GPU, do not
  implement CHERI, but will be conservative with respect to tag interaction.
  They clear tags on any memory that they overwrite, to prevent
  capability corruption or introduction.</p>

<p>Various aspects of the Morello design remain subject to change prior to the
  board becoming available in 2022.</p>

<h2 id="architecture">What ISA will Morello implement?</h2>

<p>Morello implements an architecture combining the CHERI protection model
  (synchronized to <a
  href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-951.pdf"><b>CHERI
  ISAv8</b></a>) and the ARMv8-A (application-class) ISA.
  ARMv8-A is found in a broad range of devices including almost all mobile
  devices (e.g., iOS and Android phones and tablets) as well as an increasing
  number of server-class systems.
  The experimental architecture was developed in a DARPA-supported
  collaboration, starting in 2014, between Arm, SRI International, and the
  University of Cambridge.
  In September 2020, Arm published its <a
  href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0606/A-f/?lang=en"><b>Morello
  architecture specification</b></a>, a fully elaborated integration of the
  CHERI protection model into the ARMv8-A architecture.</p>

<p>The baseline Neoverse N1 processor core implements ARMv8.2; only AArch64
  (not 32) will be supported. 
  It is expected that, except for 32-bit compatibility, all existing ARMv8.2-A
  software should work without change on Morello.
  CHERI-enabled software enables and uses the CHERI feature set
  for the purposes of fine-grained memory protection, software
  compartmentalization, and so on.
  This approach allows rigorous performance (and other) comparisons betweeen
  CHERI-aware and CHERI-unaware software stacks, as well as supporting our
  incremental adoption goals for CHERI.</p>

<p>Morello implements a <b>superset architecture</b> supporting various
  mechanisms for compartmentalisation, a collection of features for which
  there remains ongoing research into their effectiveness (e.g., accelerations
  for temporal memory safety), and multiple techniques for implementing
  tagging in the microarchitecture (see below).
  This choice impacts clock frequency, with the aim of allowing a key set of
  experiments to be run rather than to produce a commercial product.
  A production design would be expected to perform substantially better as a
  result.</p>

<p>Richard Grisenthwaite's slides from the DSbD workshop include the following
  notes regarding forward compatibility to future CHERI-enabled Arm ISAs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>The Morello Board will be the ONLY physical implementation of this
    prototype architecture.</b></li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Learnings from these experiments will be adopted into a mainstream
      extension to the Arm architecture.</b></li>
    <li><b>NO COMMITMENT TO FULL BINARY COMPATIBILITY TO THE PROTOTYPE
      ARCHITECTURE.</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>But successful concepts are expected to be carried forward into
        the architecture and can be reused there.</b></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>The architecture will have formally proved security properties, based on
  out methodology developed for CHERI-MIPS.
  See our page on  <a href="cheri-formal-b.html"><b>CHERI Rigorous
  Engineering</b></a> to learn more about this work.</p>

<h2 id="tagging">How will Morello store CHERI's tag bits?</h2>

<p>Morello supports two different implementations of physical memory
  tagging, to allow their properties to be compared experimentally.
  In one configuration, ECC bits are used to hold memory tags.
  In the other, a tag controller and tag cache are used to hold memory
  tags (see <a href="../pdfs/201711-iccd2017-efficient-tags.pdf"><b>our ICCD
  2017 paper on efficient memory tagging</b></a>).</p>

<h2 id="software">What CHERI-aware software will Morello run?</h2>

<p>The following slide from <a
  href="../pdfs/20190926-innovateuk-cheri-slides.pdf"><b>Robert Watson
  (Cambridge)'s slides</b></a> from the DSbD workshop illustrate the rough
  anticipated software stack to be available when Morello ships; portions of
  this stack remain under development:</p>

<div align=center>
<img width="80%" src="../images/20190926-cheri-morello-sw-stack.png"><br>
</div>

<p>Arm has adapted the <a href="cheri-llvm.html"><b>CHERI Clang/LLVM compiler
  suite</b></a> to target the architecture present in Morello.</p>

<p>SRI International and the University of Cambridge will are providing an
  adaptation of the <a href="cheri-software.html"><b>CheriBSD operating system
  and application stack</b></a> for Morello.
  This includes support for a spatially and referentially safe open-source
  UNIX kernel, and spatially, referentially, and temporally safe UNIX
  userspace.
  There are also the associated CHERI-adapted toolchain and tools such as the
  run-time linker, debugger, and so on.
  We currently anticipate that applications will include OpenSSH, PostgreSQL,
  and <a href="cheri-webkit.html"><b>WebKit</b></a>, as well as a host of
  other third-party open-source software packages.
  See <a href="../pdfs/201904-asplos-cheriabi.pdf"><b>ASPLOS 2019 paper on
  CheriABI for details and evaluation of the memory-safety model</b></a>.
  We will also provide a Morello-adapted memory-safe version of Google's <a
  href="https://opensource.google/projects/hafnium"><b>Hafnium
  hypervisor</b></a>.
  Unmodified ARMv8-A applications will continue to run.</p>

<p>Arm is providing an experimental adaptation of the Android operating
  system.</p>
