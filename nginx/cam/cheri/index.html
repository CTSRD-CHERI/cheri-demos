<p>
<b>CHERI (Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions)</b> is a joint
research project of SRI International and the University of Cambridge to
revisit fundamental design choices in hardware and software to dramatically
improve system security.
CHERI has been supported by the DARPA CRASH, MRC, and SSITH programs since
2010, as well as other DARPA research and transition funding.
Since 2019, development of Arm's experimental CHERI-enabled Morello processor,
SoC, and board has been supported by UKRI.
We gratefully acknowledge DARPA, UKRI, and our other supporters including
EPSRC, ERC, Google, and Arm.
</p>

<p>
CHERI extends conventional
hardware Instruction-Set Architectures (ISAs) with new architectural features
to enable fine-grained memory protection and highly scalable software
compartmentalization.
The CHERI memory-protection features allow historically memory-unsafe
programming languages such as C and C++ to be adapted to provide strong,
compatible, and efficient protection against many currently widely exploited
vulnerabilities.
The CHERI scalable compartmentalization features enable the fine-grained decomposition of
operating-system (OS) and application code, to limit the effects of security
vulnerabilities in
ways that are not supported
by current architectures.
</p>

<p>
CHERI is a <b>hybrid capability architecture</b> in that it is able to blend
<b>architectural capabilities</b> with conventional MMU-based
architectures and microarchitectures,
and with conventional software stacks based on virtual memory and C/C++.
This approach allows incremental deployment within existing software
ecosystems, which we have demonstrated through extensive hardware and software
prototyping.
</p>

<p>
CHERI interacts with the design of the full hardware-software stack.
We have developed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>An abstract CHERI protection model that introduces architectural
  capabilities, hardware-supported descriptions of permissions that can be
  used, in place of integer virtual addresses, to refer to data, code, and
  objects in protected ways;</li>
<li>A set of ISA extensions to 64-bit MIPS, 32-bit RISC-V, 64-bit RISC-V, and
  (in collaboration with Arm) 64-bit Armv8-A, showing that the model is
  applicable to a range of contemporary ISA designs.
</li><li>New microarchitecture demonstrating that capabilities can be
  implemented efficiently in hardware, including capability compression and
  tagged memory to protect capabilities in memory; and</li>
<li>Formal models of these ISA extensions enabling mechanised
  statements and proofs of their security
  properties, automatic test generation, and automatic construction of
  executable ISA-level simulators.</li>
</ul>

<p>These features enable new software constructs that are incrementally
  deployable within existing software ecosystems.
  Through extensive prototyping and co-design, we have demonstrated and
  evaluated:</p>
<ul>
<li>New software construction models that use capabilities to provide
  fine-grained memory protection and scalable software
  compartmentalization;</li>
<li>Language and compiler extensions to use capabilities in implementing
  memory-safe C and C++, higher-level managed languages, and Foreign Function
  Interfaces (FFIs);</li>
<li>OS extensions to use fine-grained memory protection, and to support
  applications that use CHERI, including through spatial, referential, and
  temporal memory safety;</li>
<li>OS extensions that provide new CHERI-based abstractions including in-kernel
  and intra-process compartmentalization, and new efficient Inter-Process
  Communication (IPC);</li>
<li>Application-level adaptations to operate correctly with CHERI memory
  protection; and</li>
<li>Application-level adaptations to introduce new and more affordable
  software compartmentalization.</li>
</ul>

<p>CHERI is a hardware/software/semantics co-design project, combining
  hardware implementation, adaption of mainstream software stacks, and formal
  semantics and proof.
  The CHERI ideas have been developed first as a modification to 64-bit
  MIPS and now also for 32/64-bit RISC-V and 64-bit ARMv8-A.
  We have prototyped a complete software stack for CHERI by adapting widely
  used open-source software such as <a href="cheri-llvm.html"><b>Clang/LLVM</b></a>, <a href="cheribsd.html"><b>FreeBSD</b></a>, FreeRTOS, and
  applications such as <a href="cheri-webkit.html"><b>WebKit</b></a>, OpenSSH, and PostgreSQL.
  We have formally modeled the architecture and constructed a number of proofs
  about its security, as well as used these models for microarchitectural
  validation in our prototypes.
  These models also have the potential to support further activities such as
  formal proofs about software and microarchitecture.</p>

<p>We have <a href="cheri-publications.html"><b>published a number of technical
  reports and papers on the CHERI approach</b></a>, including on the
  instruction set and its design, on how efficient microarchitecture can support
  the CHERI model, and on how software  can be adapted to use CHERI's
  architectural features.</p>

<h2 id="transition">CHERI for ARMv8-A and RISC-V</h2>

<p>In addition to our CHERI-MIPS FPGA prototypes and software, as well as
formal models, we are working actively to bring CHERI to the ARMv8-A and
RISC-V ecosystems:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>ARMv8-A</b></dt>
<dd><p>Since 2014, supported by DARPA, we have been collaborating with Arm
  to develop an experimental integration of CHERI with 64-bit ARMv8-A.
  InnovateUK will be jointly funding the creation of <a href="cheri-morello.html"><b>an experimental
  superscalar CHERI-ARM processor (based on the Neoverse N1), SoC, and
  evaluation board ("Morello")</b></a> to be available for academic and
  industrial research from late 2021.</p>

  <p>We will bring our full CHERI software stack to Morello, as well as
  performing formal modeling and verification as part of the effort, and are
  already able to use the full CheriBSD software stack on an early ISA-level
  model. EPSRC and ESRC have announced funding calls to support CHERI-related
  research on the board. We look forward to supporting this programme of
  research through software prototypes and formal models. More information on
  this effort can be found in our <a href="dsbd.html"><b>Digital Security by
  Design</b></a> page.</p></dd>

  <p>Arm released a software simulator and open-source toolchain (based on
  CHERI Clang/LLVM) in late 2020, and we have open sourced CheriBSD for Morello
  as well as CHERI GDB.</p>

<dt><b>RISC-V</b></dt>
<dd><p>Since 2017, supported by DARPA, we have been creating an experimental
  adaptation of CHERI to the 32-bit and 64-bit RISC-V ISAs. This includes
  multiple FPGA prototypes based on Bluespec and MIT BSV-language cores:
  3-stage, 32-bit MMU-free RISC-V; 5-stage 64-bit RISC-V; and superscalar
  64-bit RISC-V. CHERI ISAv7 includes a fully elaborated version of the
  CHERI-RISC-V ISA. CHERI Clang/LLVM are already up and running, and we are
  able to boot a pure-capability CheriFreeRTOS on the 32-bit core. We are in
  the process of bringing up the remainder of our software stack including
  CheriBSD on the first 64-bit core. This work is available as open source in
  our GitHub repositories.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="cheri-mips-fpga">Prototype CHERI-MIPS processor on FPGA</h2>
<p>
We have developed a prototype of the CHERI ISA using the <a href="../beri/">Bluespec Extensible RISC Implementation (BERI)</a>, a 64-bit
MIPS FPGA soft core implemented in the Bluespec HDL.
The FreeBSD operating system has also been ported to
CHERI in order to allow us to compare, side-by-side, traditional software
compartmentalisation approaches (based on a translation look-aside buffer
(TLB)), with those supported by a capability coprocessor.
We run lightly modified commodity software stacks (see below) on this
prototype, allowing us to validate our hybrid design, evaluating
compatibility, performance, and security implications of our changes to
hardware and software.
</p>
 

<h2 id="cheri-software">Prototype CHERI software stack</h2>

<p>We have developed a significant <a href="cheri-software.html"><b>CHERI
prototype software stack</b></a> to explore and evaluate the implications of
CHERI on compatibility, performance, and security for off-the-shelf C/C++
software stacks.
This includes adapted versions of the Clang/LLVM compiler suite, FreeBSD and
FreeRTOS operating systems, and numerous userspace libraries and applications,
including WebKit, to run on the CHERI Architecture.</p>

<h2 id="cheri-formal">CHERI rigorous engineering</h2>
<p>
  CHERI uses a range of <a href="cheri-formal.html">rigorous engineering</a> techniques to speed development and increase assurance, in a hardware/software/semantics co-design process.   We use formal models of the complete instruction-set architectures (ISA) at the heart of our design and engineering, both in lightweight ways that support and improve normal engineering practice - as documentation, in emulators used as a test oracle for hardware and for running software, and for test generation - and for formal verification.  We formalise key intended security properties of the ISA specifications, and establish that these hold with mechanised proof.  This is for the same complete ISA models (complete enough to boot operating systems), without idealisation.  The ISA model for <a href="https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/sail-cheri-mips">CHERI-MIPS</a>, in <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/">Sail</a>, is available.
Our work on CHERI C/C++, and on porting software to them, is also informed by and informs our <a href="https//www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/cerberus">Cerberus</a> work on de facto and ISO C semantics.
All this is in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/rems/">REMS project</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="cheri-qemu">QEMU-CHERI</h2>
<p>We have also developed a <a href="cheri-qemu.html">QEMU CHERI-MIPS</a>
implementation, which provides an ISA-level emulation of our CHERI extensions
to the 64-bit MIPS ISA.
While not micro-architecturally realistic, this emulation can be useful for
software development, especially in the absence of an FPGA or access to
Bluespec.
It is faster than the Sail-generated C emulator, but less directly based on
the Sail CHERI-MIPS ISA specification.
