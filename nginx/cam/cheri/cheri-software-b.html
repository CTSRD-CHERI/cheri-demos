<p>This page describes our CHERI software-stack prototypes, including the
  <a href="cheri-llvm.html"><b>CHERI Clang/LLVM/LLD compiler suite and
  linker</b></a>, <a href="cheribsd.html"><b>CheriBSD operating
  system</b></a>, and QEMU-CHERI ISA-level simulator.
  We have also performed CHERI adaptations of the GDB debugger, FreeRTOS
  embedded operating system, and Spike RISC-V simulator, as well as
  applications such as <a href="cheri-webkit.html"><b>WebKit</b></a>.
  Entirely new software is released under a BSD license; extensions to
  existing software packages are released under the license used by that
  package.</p>

<p>Our recent <a href="../pdfs/201904-asplos-cheriabi.pdf"><b>ASPLOS 2019
  paper on CheriABI</b></a> provides the best current general introduction to
  CHERI memory safety for operating systems and applications.
  There is also an <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-932.pdf"><b>extended
  CheriABI technical report</b></a> that contains additional implementation
  information on this work.</p>

<h2>CHERI Clang/LLVM compiler suite, LLD linker, and GDB debugger</h2>
<p>
<a href="cheri-llvm.html"><b>CHERI Clang/LLVM and LLD</b></a> are a complete
compiler suite and compile-time linker for use with the CHERI architecture as
instantiated for 64-bit MIPS and 32/64-bit RISC-V.
We have also adapted the GDB debugger to use CHERI.
The suite targets two C interpretations and ABIs:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Hybrid-capability C and binary code</dt>
<dd><i>Hybrid-capability C/C++</i> starts with the conventional integer
  implementation of C/C++ pointers, but allows types to be optionally
  qualified in order to trigger implementation using CHERI capabilities.
  This model could also transparently introduce capability use where it does
  not interfere with existing ABIs.
  This model is typically used in low-level OS components and compatibility
  layers, such as in allowing the pure-capability CheriABI process environment
  to be implemented over a hybrid-capability kernel.</dd>

<dt>Pure-capability C and binary code</dt>
<dd><i>Pure-capability C/C++</i> implements all C/C++ pointers using CHERI
  capabilities.
  This includes explicit pointers (such as explicitly declared pointers to
  functions, global variables, local variables, and heap allocations), and
  also implicit pointers (such as return addresses, and GOT pointers).
  This model is suitable for a broad variety of uses, including in providing
  strong memory safety for operating-system kernels and user
  applications.
  CHERI C is documented in our <a
  href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-947.pdf"><b>CHERI
  C/C++ Programming Guide</b></a>.
</dd>
</dl>


<h2>CheriBSD operating system</h2>
<p>
<a href="cheribsd.html"><b>CheriBSD</b></a> is an adaptation of the
open-source <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD operating system</a> to
utilize the CHERI Architecture's capability-system model.
CheriBSD provides strong CHERI-based memory protection for the kernel and
userspace, as well as support for scalable single-address-space software
compartmentalization.
By default, the kernel is compiled as a hybrid-capability binary, but we have
experimental extensions that allow it to run as a pure-capability binary.
Both kernels support running existing off-the-shelf userspace MIPS and RISC-V
binaries, as well as pure-capability binaries running in the CheriABI process
environment.
CheriBSD runs on 64-bit CHERI-MIPS and 64-bit CHERI-RISC-V.
</p>


<h2>QEMU-CHERI</h2>
<p>We have also developed a <a href="cheri-qemu.html"><b>QEMU
CHERI-MIPS and CHERI-RISC-V</b></a> implementation, which provides an
ISA-level emulation of our CHERI extensions to the 64-bit MIPS and RISC-V
ISAs.
While not micro-architecturally realistic, this emulation can be useful for
software development, especially in the absence of an FPGA or access to
Bluespec.
It is faster than the Sail-generated C emulator, but less directly based on
the Sail CHERI-MIPS and CHERI-RISC-V ISA specifications.
</p>

<h2>Other ported software</h2>
<p>In addition to software packages such as OpenSSL and OpenSSH that are
included in <a href="cheribsd.html"><b>CheriBSD</b></a>, we have ported
a number of other applications to CHERI.
These include:
