<h1>The CAPcelerate project</h1>


<div class="ucampas-toc"></div>

<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>

<p>CAPcelerate is a Â£1.2m project funded by the UK Industrial Strategy Challenge
Fund's <a href="../dsbd.html"><b>Digital Security by Design</b></a> (DSbD)
programme, led by <a href="/~tmj32">Dr Timothy Jones</a> and <a
href="/~atm26">Dr A. Theodore Markettos</a>.</p>

<p>In parallel with the production of <a
href="../cheri-morello.html"><b>Morello</b></a> platform, the project seeks
to consider the implications of using CHERI capabilities in various classes
of accelerators, such as GPUs, AI and crypto accelerators and FPGAs.  In
particular we are interested in workloads that have rich software stacks
that interwork with CPU code in shared memory.  We are considering whether
it is feasible to add capability support to such accelerators and their
software stacks (compilers, drivers, libraries, etc), or whether
alternative schemes can be used to protect from accelerators that might be
running malicious software, or potentially malicious hardware itself (for
example, a malicious external Thunderbolt GPU).</p>

<p>CAPcelerate considers several aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understanding the usage model of software on top of current
accelerators, and particularly how that might be relevant to
capability-enabled accelerator hardware.  Typically, there is great
diversity in such software and there is often not a common software model -
for example, for GPGPUs there are OpenCL, CUDA, ROCm, OneAPI, SYCL and
others.  Other types of accelerators have different software stacks (eg
Tensorflow for machine learning accelerators).</li>

<li>Understanding the challenges of implementing capabilities in hardware in
a device that is substantially different from CPUs where capabilities have
been implemented to date.  Is it feasible to build an accelerator where
capabilities are used as a native datatype, and can we address the
challenges in microarchitecture?</li>

<li>Integrating such capability hardware in a system, for example in a
system-on-chip, in order to offer security guarantees from CPU across
interconnect to accelerator.</li>

<li>Exploring opportunities for capability protection in driver code,
whether or not a capability-enabled accelerator is used.  For example,
compartmentalisation of drivers using CHERI compartments to offer more
protection from malicious driver code than the current way drivers are built
today.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project builds on other recent work.  In particular, we published <a
href="https://thunderclap.io/"><b>Thunderclap</b></a>, a series of
vulnerabilities in commodity operating systems' use of Input/Output Memory
Management Unit (IOMMU) protection against malicious devices such as network
cards.  In response to the publication of the Thunderclap paper, a number of
vendors including Apple, Microsoft, Intel and others have improved their
IOMMU protections and use of them has been mandated in the USB 4 and
Thunderbolt 4 standards.</p>

<p>Thunderclap is part of the EPSRC-funded IOSEC project, part of the <a
href="https://www.ukrise.org/"><b>RISE initiative</b></a>.  IOSEC has
additionally been considering other forms of protection from malicious
peripheral devices, such as networking and storage.</p>
