<h1>CHERI Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

<p>
  Here are answers to some of the common questions we've received (or in some
  cases, anticipate) about CHERI.
  See the <a href="../beri/faq.html">BERI FAQ</a> for questions about the BERI
  platform.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>What is CHERI?</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>CHERI refers to <b>Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions</b>, an
    Instruction-Set Architecture (ISA) extension that implements a hybrid
    capability-system model providing fine-grained memory protection and
    scalable software compartmentalisation within architectural address
    spaces (e.g., within user processes or the kernel).
    CHERI capabilities are a new hardware data type intended to support the
    robust and secure implementation of <b>pointers</b>.
    Capabilities hold a virtual address as well as metadata describing the
    memory resources referenced by the pointer (bounds, permissions, ...) and
    also a 1-bit tag that protects the pointer itself (integrity, valid
    provenance, ...).
    The architecture (and hence hardware) protects pointers in registers and
    memory, controlling their 
creation and use (e.g., nonforgeability and nonbypassability), 
manipulation (e.g., enforcing monotonicity on bounds modifications and
    permissions), 
ensuring only authorized use (e.g., dereference within bounds), and also their
in-memory integrity (e.g., detecting pointer corruption or injection).
    Policies are expressed by the software (OS, compiler, language runtime,
    and application) and enforced by the hardware.</p>

    <p>CHERI capabilities are a low-level primitive usable for many purposes.
    We employ them in implementing pointer protection and fine-grained
    memory protection for the C and C++ programming languages, for safe
    inter-language interoperability, and also for scalable fine-grained
    software compartmentalization.
    CHERI is targeted by the compiler and used to represent
    programming-language-level protection properties, in contrast to
    conventional memory management units (MMUs) that are used to construct
    page-based virtual memory by operating systems.
    In CHERI, the capability coprocessor and MMU live side by side;
    being a hybrid model, they provide strong protection guarantees while
    allowing significant compatibility with current software at both binary
    and source-code levels -- a technique inspired by our earlier work on <a
    href="../../capsicum/">Capsicum</a>, a hybrid capability-system model for
    UNIX.</p>

  <p>CHERI also refers to our prototype MIPS-based implementation of the ISA
    in FPGA, embodied in a capability coprocessor in the BERI MIPS
    implementation.
    We have released the BERI source code, along with adaptations of the <a
    href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD operating system</a> (CheriBSD) and
    <a href="http://www.llvm.org/">LLVM compiler suite</a> (CHERI Clang/LLVM).
    We have also adapted tools such as the GDB debugger and LLVM linker (LLD)
    to support conventional software development.
    Please see our <a href="../beri/downloads-hw.html">hardware downloads</a>
    and <a href="../beri/downloads-sw.html">software downloads</a> pages for
    more information.
    Research into BERI and CHERI has primarily been supported by DARPA and
    Google, but we've also had PhD students and postdocs supported by ARM, HP,
    Microsoft, EPSRC, ERC, and other government and industrial sponsors.  We
    are very grateful to all of these sponsors, without whom this work could
    not have been done!</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>What ISA(s) does CHERI extend?</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>To date, our published research has been based on the 64-bit MIPS ISA;
    MIPS was the dominant RISC ISA in use in 2010 when the project began.
    We have a fully elaborated CHERI-MIPS ISA including formal model of the
    instruction set (which have been used for security proofs), executable
    QEMU model, and Bluespec SystemVerilog (BSV) implementation targeted at
    FPGA.
    This is a mature architecture targeted by a CHERI-extended version of the
    Clang/LLVM compiler suite, and able to run complete open-source software
    stacks including CheriBSD (a CHERI-extended version of FreeBSD) and
    applications such as OpenSSH, PostgreSQL, and WebKit.
    However, since that time we have performed significant investigation into
    CHERI as <i>portable architectural security model</i> suitable for use in
    multiple ISAs.
    A key goal of this investigation has been to demonstrate that portable
    C/C++-language software stacks -- including compiler toolchain, operating
    systems, and applications -- can benefit from the same protection
    properties with minimal architecture-specific adaptation beyond the
    compiler backend and low-level architecture-specific OS components.</p>

  <p>The advent of the open RISC-V ISA provides us with a richer spectrum of
    baseline processor designs, and as the architecture matures over time, we
    hope also a similarly rich software ecosystem.
    RISC-V may also create new potential technology-transition possibilities.
    We have now created an elaborated CHERI-RISC-V ISA specification suitable
    for use with both 32-bit and 64-bit RISC-V.
    We have similarly developed a formal model of CHERI-RISC-V, and are now
    adapting multiple open-source processor cores from Bluespec to implement
    CHERI.
    Early versions of the CHERI Clang/LLVM compiler suite are now functional
    and able to compile pure-capability C code for the bare-metal architecture.
    We anticipate a more complete hardware-software stack in late 2019.
    </p>

  <p>We have also developed an "architectural sketch" of a CHERI-x86-64 that
    extends the 64-bit x86 ISA with CHERI support.
    The sketch explores the design space and potential directions, but is not
    currently supported by a complete ISA specification or implementation.</p>

  <p>More information on CHERI-MIPS, CHERI-RISC-V, and CHERI-x86-64 can be
    found in our <a
    href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-927.pdf"><i>Capability
    Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions: CHERI Instruction-Set
    Architecture (Version 7)</i></a> technical report.</p>

<dt><b>What is a hybrid capability system?</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p><i>Capabilities</i> are unforgeable tokens of authority that may be
    passed from subject to subject (<i>delegated</i>) granting rights to
    objects; typically, capabilites incorporate both a reference to an object
    and a mask of permissions reflecting possible operations or methods on the
    object.
    Conventional <i>capability systems</i> constrain executing code such that
    executing code can access only objects as permitted via capabilities; this
    limitation might be enforced by constraints imposed by an ISA,
    operating-system API, programming language, network protocol, or even by
    static or dynamic limits imposed on a program using code analysis or
    transformation.
    Microkernels (such as seL4) often implement capability systems as their
    fundamental security model, as the model provides a strong mechanism on
    which many different policies can be implemented.</p>

  <p>A <i>hybrid</i> capability system is one in which more conventional system
    designs (such as a UNIX kernel or RISC processor) are adapted to support a
    capability model such that some, but not all, code is limited by
    capability-system constraints, and a set of pragmatic tradeoffs are
    adopted to allow conventional system objects to be exposed via more
    capability-esque models.
    For example, <a
    href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/">Capsicum</a>
    composes a capability-system model with the UNIX API, treating file
    descriptors as capabilities, and allowing selected processes to be marked
    as losing access to global system namespaces, in effect, imposing a
    capability system.
    Hybrid capability systems offer improved adoptability by allowing
    components of existing applications to be selectively migrated to a
    least-privilege programming model, although at the cost of reduced
    robustness and security as compared to a pure capability system and
    application suite written entirely with those goals in mind.</p>

  <p>CHERI is a hybrid capability system in several senses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>CHERI's capability system is blended with a conventional RISC
       usermode architecture without disrupting the majority of key design
       decisions.</li>
    <li>CHERI's capabililty system is cleanly and usefully composed with
       conventional ring-based privileges and virtual memory based on Memory
       Management Units (MMUs).</li>
    <li>CHERI can be targeted by a C/C++-language compiler with strong
       compatibility, performance, and protection properties.</li>
    <li>CHERI supports a range of OS models including conventional MMU-based
       virtual-memory designs, hybridized designs that host capability-based
       software within multiple virtual address spaces, and pure
       single-address-space capability systems.</li>
    <li>CHERI is incrementally adoptable: Within pieces of software,
       capability-based design can be disregarded, partially adopted, or fully
       adopted with useful and predictable semantics.</li>
  </ul>
</dd>

<dt><b>What is the difference between BERI and CHERI?</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>BERI is the Bluespec Extensible RISC Implementation, a hardware
    description of a 64-bit pipelined RISC processor, with debugging
    tools and C-language simulated buses and devices.
    <a href="../cheri.html">CHERI</a> is a set of ISA and implementation
    extensions providing fine-grained memory protection and support for
    scalable software compartmentalisation developed as part of the <a
    href="../">CTSRD Project</a> joint between <a
    href="http://www.csl.sri.com/">SRI International</a> and the <a
    href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.ul">University of Cambridge Computer
    Laboratory</a>.</p>

  <p>The BERI implementation includes optionally compiled support for CHERI,
    enabled via the CP2 flag at compile-time.
    CHERI occupies the coprocessor-2 instruction encoding space, and must be
    explicitly enabled.
    You may find <a
    href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-927.pdf"><i>Capability
    Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions: CHERI Instruction-Set
    Architecture (Version 7)</i></a> technical report and our <a
    href=".">various research papers</a> useful reading if this is of
    interest.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of our work on CHERI-RISC-V, we are building on a set
    of open-source Bluespec SystemVerilog (BSV) cores designed at Bluespec
    and MIT, rather than building the baseline CPU from scratch.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Why 32 capability registers?</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>As our starting point was the 64-bit MIPS ISA, we made a number of design
    choices to maximise congruence in the CHERI ISA, including selecting 32
    capability registers to correspond to the 32 general-purpose integer
    registers in the MIPS ISA.
    In CHERI-RISC-V, we support both <i>split register files</i> (in which
    capability registers are in their own independent architectural register
    file) and a <i>merged register file</i>, in which general-purpose integer
    registers are extended to capability width.
    There are a number of architectural and microarchitectural implications to
    these design choices, which we hope to explore further in our research.
    </p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Why a separate capability register file?</b></dt>
<dd>
    <p>Our decision to use a separate register file for capabilities is also
    one that could be revisited: We modeled CHERI as a CP2 extension to MIPS,
    but there is no reason to think that we could not extend a general-purpose
    64-bit register file to hold 128-bit capabilities (plus tags) in the same
    style that 32-bit register files are extended to 64 bits in many 64-bit
    architectures.
    This might offer reduced microarchitectural overhead by avoiding
    additional control logic for a second register file.
    Our CHERI RISC-V design supports both split and merged register files,
    which will allow us to evaluate this design choice and its impact on
    hardware and software.
  </p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Could you do it with fewer than 256 bits?</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>Over CHERI ISA versions 4 to 7, we explored and developed a 128-bit
    compressed capability format employing fat-pointer compression techniques.
    This approach exploits redundancy between the two 64-bit virtual addresses
    representing bounds and the 64-bit pointer itself.
    The CHERI-128 approach retains strong C-language compatibility (e.g.,
    out-of-bounds pointers) and retains our required security properties (e.g.,
    monotonicity), while also achieving good microarchitectural performance
    (i.e., avoiding multi-cycle delays for key operations).
    128-bit capabilities substantially reduce the data-cache overhead of CHERI
    for pointer-intensive workloads.
    Support for 128-bit capabilities can be found in recent versions of our
    CHERI FPGA prototype and also QEMU-CHERI.
    Our <a href="../pdfs/2019tc-cheri-concentrate.pdf">2019 IEEE TC paper on
    CHERI Concentrate</a> documents our approach in detail.
</dd>

<dt><b>Why tagged memory?</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>Many memory-based attacks on contemporary hardware-software designs rely
    on corrupting pointers or lengths.
    Tags provide strong pointer-integrity guarantees that are difficult to
    implement efficiently without hardware support.
    Tags add one bit of memory for every 128 or 256 bits of data, with a
    &lt;1% memory overhead; they are maintained with cache lines, and obey
    normal cache-coherency rules.
    In our CHERI prototype, we partition physical memory, setting aside a
    portion to hold tags, rather than requiring a change to memory interfaces.
    Currently, that partition is hard-coded, but it would ideally be managed
    by the firmware or software supervisor.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>How does CHERI compare with other memory-protection schemes?</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>Our <a href="../pdfs/201406-isca2014-cheri.pdf">2014 ISCA paper</a>
    includes a detailed comparison of the protection semantics and performance
    of CHERI as compared to other schemes, including software bounds checking,
    Intel MPX, HardBound, Mondriaan, and M-Machine.
    Each selects a different point in a larger tradeoff space.
    Key design choices that have motivated CHERI include a focus on providing
    strong protection for C-language pointers, hybridization with MMU-based
    virtualization, avoidance of hardware lookup tables and associative
    structures in the microarchitecture, and strong support for existing
    software stacks.
    More recent papers at venues such as IEEE SSP and ASPLOS have elaborated
    on these overheads as we pursue utilizing capabilities in more and
    more aspects of software design.</p>
