<h1>CHERI and Microkernels</h1>

<p>
Following the <a href="../workshops/">first CHERI Microkernel Workshop</a> in
April 2016, there has been substantial interest in whether CHERI's
architectural features can help support more expressive or performant
microkernel designs.
At one end of the spectrum, current virtual-memory-based microkernels (e.g.,
seL4, L4, Barrelfish) could be extended to support in-address-space memory
protection and compartmentalisation, much in the style of <a
href="../cheribsd/">CheriBSD</a>.
They could also be extended to use certain CHERI features to improve
performance &mdash; for example, using sealed capabilities to avoid entering
the kernel for certain types of delegation operations.
At the other extreme, CHERI's protection and compartmentalisation features
could be used in place of MMU-based techniques to implement a single
address-space operating-system design, minimising or entirely eliminating use
of virtual memory.
