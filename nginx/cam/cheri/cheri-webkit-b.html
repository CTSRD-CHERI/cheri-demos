<h1>CHERI-WebKit</h1>

<p>
CHERI-WebKit is a port of the <a href="https://webkit.org"><b>WebKit browser
engine</b></a>, developed in collaboration with Arm, to the <a
href="."><b>CHERI protection model</b></a>, and in particular to Arm's <a
href="cheri-morello.html"><b>Morello<b></a> architecture.
It will serve as a platform for measuring CHERI's impact on performance and
security in complex applications like language runtimes.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This is experimental software, and is only partially adapted
  to use the CHERI protection model.
  While the initial aim has been to support performance analysis, to
  understand the implications of CHERI's larger pointer size and impact on
  the JSC JIT, we are now exploring deploying CHERI memory safety to harden
  the browser engine and language runtime.</p>

<h2>JavaScriptCore</h2>

<p>
Work to date has focused on JavaScriptCore (JSC), WebKit's JavaScript runtime. Our
port supports multiple tiers of optimization, including the C-loop interpreter,
low-level interpreter, and baseline JIT compiler. To facilitate the evaluation of
performance and security tradeoffs, JSC can be built with pure-capability
compilation, which implements all pointers as CHERI capabilities; hybrid
compilation, which leaves most pointers as integers; and a third option that
implements all pointers as CHERI capabilites except for the JavaScript virtual
machine's pointers to the JavaScript heap, which remain integers. In this third
model, the use of integer pointers is restricted to the JavaScript heap by
Morello's default data capability.
CHERI-WebKit relies on the <a href="cheribsd.html"><b>CheriBSD</b></a>
operating system, and its memory-safe <a
href="../pdfs/201904-asplos-cheriabi.pdf"><b>CheriABI process
environment</b></a>.

<h2>Building and running CHERI-Webkit</h2>

<p>
The CHERI-Webkit source is available in the
<a href="https://github.com/ctsrd-cheri/webkit"><b>CHERI-WebKit GitHub
repository</b></a>. It can be easily
built and run on Arm's Morello FVP software model using our
<a href="https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribuild"><b>cheribuild
tool</b></a>. To
build it, run the following command line, which will build the Morello
toolchain and CheriBSD as well as JavaScriptCore and its dependencies:
</p>

<pre>
./cheribuild.py --include-dependencies morello-webkit-morello-purecap
</pre>

<p>
To enable support for baseline JIT compilation, append the following
switch to the above command:
</p>

<pre>
--morello-webkit-morello-purecap/backend tier2asm
</pre>

<p>
The following command line will then download the Arm FVP model, create
a disk image that includes JSC, and run the model:
</p>

<pre>
./cheribuild.py --include-dependencies run-fvp-morello-purecap
</pre>

<p>
You can then run JSC on the FVP model as follows:
</p>

<pre>
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/morello-purecap/webkit/lib:/usr/local/morello-purecap/lib /opt/morello-purecap/webkit/bin/jsc
</pre>

<p>
To run JavaScript files (e.g. the
<a href="https://github.com/ctsrd-cheri/webkit/tree/master/PerformanceTests/SunSpider/tests/sunspider-1.0.2">SunSpider</a>
benchmark suite), create and add them to cheribuild's extra files directory,
(default ~/cheri/extra-files), rebuild the disk image, and re-run the model:
</p>

<pre>
mkdir -p ~/cheri/extra-files/js
cp [js files] ~/cheri/extra-files/js
cheribuild disk-image-morello-purecap
cheribuild run-fvp-morello-purecap
</pre>

<p>
You can then run the files on the model as follows:
</p>

<pre>
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/morello-purecap/webkit/lib:/usr/local/morello-purecap/lib /opt/morello-purecap/webkit/bin/jsc /js/[js file]
</pre>

<p>
You can also use cheribuild to run the SunSpider benchmark suite directly on the QEMU model:
</p>

<pre>
cheribuild morello-webkit-morello-purecap --test
</pre>
