<h1>BERI open-source downloads</h1>

<table bgcolor="#ddddff" border="0"><tr><td>Newflash - June 18 2014: we are
  currently preparing open-source downloads of the BERI processor, and expect
  BERI to be available for download later
  today.  Physical build specs for the Terasic DE4-based tablet, as well as
  FreeBSD OS support for BERI, are already online.</td></tr></table>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.csl.sri.com/">SRI International</a> and the <a
  href="/">University of Cambridge</a> have developed <a
  href="index.html">BERI</a>, a pipelined 64-bit RISC FPGA soft-core processor
  designed for teaching and research in the hardware-software interface.
  BERI is implemented in <a href="http://www.bluespec.com/">Bluespec</a>, a
  high-level hardware definition language (HDL) that compiles to efficient C
  simulation or Verilog descriptions suitable for FPGA implementation.
  BERI is able to boot the open-source <a
  href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD UNIX operating system</a>, which
  supports multitasking, TCP/IP networking, multiple filesystems, POSIX APIs,
  advanced security features, a has drivers for a variety of devices found on
  Terasic's FPGA boards, as well as many thousands of third-party open-source
  applications.
  We use the BERI hardware-software platform daily in our teaching and
  research (e.g., <a href="../cheri.html">CHERI</a>), and hope that others
  will find it useful as well!
</p>

<h2>License and Disclaimer</h2>

<p>
  BERI is distributed under the <a
  href="http://www.beri-open-systems.org/legal/beri-hardware-software-license.txt">BERI Hardware-Software License</a>, a lightly modified version of the Apache Software License enhanced to better support open-source hardware.
  <a href="http://www.beri-open-systems.org/">BERI Open Systems CIC</a> is a
  UK-based not-for-profit responsible for receiving contributors' agreements
  for BERI.
</p>

<p>
  The BERI hardware-software platform is highly experimental; users are
  cautioned that damage to physical FPGA hardware can result from bugs or user
  error.
  The BERI hardware-software open-source license places further limitations on
  warranty and liability.
</p>

<h2>Downloads</h2>

<p>
  BERI consists of a number of components including: physical designs (e.g.,
  tablet packaging for the Terasic DE4); HDL descriptions of the processor
  and several peripherals; and adaptations of FreeBSD and other open-source
  software to support BERI.

  We have open sourced the hardware specs and build instructions for our
  Terasic DE4-based tablet design.

<dt><b>BERI hardware description</b> - June 2014</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  We are preparing to release our Bluespec hardware description of the BERI
  processor, peripherals such as our BERI programmable interrupt controller,
  C-language simulations exposing UNIX devices within the simulation (e.g.,
  disk images as SD cards), and control/debugging tool cherictl.
  We expect to announce this release in early 2014.

<dt><b>BERI test suite</b> - June 2014</dt>

<p>
  We have developed an extensive ISA-level test suite and pipeline fuzzing
  tools for the BERI processor.

<dt><b>FreeBSD/beri operating-system support</b> - October 2013</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  We are pleased to announce that complete support for the BERI processor and
  peripherals has been upstreamed to the <a
  href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD 10.x and 11.x operating systems</a>.
  FreeBSD provides a full 64-bit UNIX environment including MMU-based process
  model, support for the BERI floating point unit, preemptive multitasking and
  multithreading, POSIX APIs, advanced security features such as Capsicum and
  mandatory access control, network services such as SSH, UNIX shells, gcc,
  Clang/LLVM, and tens of thousands of third-party applications.
</p>

<p>
  The forthcoming FreeBSD 10.0 release (now in BETA) will include support for
  all BERI features, including the BERI processor, programmable interrupt
  controller, and many common hard- and soft-core peripherals including those
  found on the Terasic DE4: Altera triple-speed MAC (atse), Intel Strata
  Flash, Altera JTAG UART, 16550 UART, Altera University Programme SD Card
  Controller, on-board switches and LEDs, and Terasic's MTL capacitive
  multi-touch display.
  The result is a complete 64-bit operating system able to run tens of
  thousands of open-source applications "out of the box".
