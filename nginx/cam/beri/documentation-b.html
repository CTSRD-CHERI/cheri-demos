<h1>BERI documentation</h1>

<p>
  BERI (and CHERI) are accompanied by a number of technical reports
  documenting their design, implementation, and use, both from hardware and
  software development perspectives.

reference</a> (UCAM-TR-868)</dt>
<dd>An introduction to the BERI CPU, getting started guide for configuring
your environment and running the
CPU in simulation, details of the CPU architecture for BERI1 and BERI2,
instruction set architecture (ISA), description of hardware peripherals on
the DE4 board. (Previous version UCAM-TR-852) </dd>

reference</a> (UCAM-TR-869)</dt>
<dd>Guide to building FreeBSD/beri and booting, both in simulation and on
the DE4 board. (Previous version UCAM-TR-853) </dd>

Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions: CHERI Programmer's Guide</a>
(UCAM-TR-877)</dt>
<dd>The Userâ€™s Guide is targeted at hardware and
software developers working with capability-enhanced software. It describes
the CheriBSD operating system, a version of the FreeBSD operating system
that has been adapted to support userspace capability systems via the CHERI
ISA, and the CHERI Clang/LLVM compiler suite. It also describes the earlier
Deimos demonstration microkernel.  (Previous version UCAM-TR-851)</dd>

Instruction-Set Architecture</a> (UCAM-TR-877)</dt>
<dd>This report describes the CHERI architecture and design, and provides
reference documentation for the CHERI instruction-set architecture (ISA) and
potential memory models, along with their requirements. It also documents
our current thinking on integration of programming languages and operating
systems. (Previous versions UCAM-TR-850, UCAM-TR-864) </dd>
