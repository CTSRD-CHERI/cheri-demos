<h1>BERI open-source hardware downloads</h1>

<table bgcolor="#ddffdd" border="0"><tr><td>Newflash - May 18 2015:
  we have made a <a href="downloads-hw.html">new release of the BERI/CHERI</a>
  source code, which has been updated for our most recent architectural changes
  and includes everything necessary to synthesise BERI on an Altera FPGA.
  </td></tr></table>

<table bgcolor="#ffdddd" border="0"><tr><td>Newflash - June 18 2014: the
  BERI/CHERI source code is now available for download!  Physical build specs for the Terasic DE4-based tablet are
  online, as is <a href="downloads-sw.html">FreeBSD OS support for BERI</a>,
  which was merged to FreeBSD 10.0 in August 2012.</td></tr></table>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.csl.sri.com/">SRI International</a> and the <a
  href="/">University of Cambridge</a> have developed <a
  href="index.html">BERI</a>, a pipelined 64-bit RISC FPGA soft-core processor
  designed for teaching and research in the hardware-software interface.
  BERI is implemented in <a href="http://www.bluespec.com/">Bluespec</a>, a
  high-level hardware definition language (HDL) that compiles to efficient C
  simulation or Verilog descriptions suitable for FPGA implementation.
  BERI is able to boot the open-source <a
  href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD UNIX operating system</a>, which
  supports multitasking, TCP/IP networking, multiple filesystems, POSIX APIs,
  advanced security features, a has drivers for a variety of devices found on
  Terasic's FPGA boards, as well as many thousands of third-party open-source
  applications.
  We use the BERI hardware-software platform daily in our teaching and
  research (e.g., <a href="../cheri.html">CHERI</a>), and hope that others
  will find it useful as well!
</p>

<h2>Hardware Downloads</h2>
<p>
  BERI consists of a number of components including: physical designs (e.g.,
  tablet packaging for the Terasic DE4); HDL descriptions of the processor
  and several peripherals; and adaptations of FreeBSD and other open-source
  software to support BERI.

<dt><b>BERI hardware description</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>
  We have open sourced the Bluespec hardware description of the BERI1
  and BERI2 processors, integrated peripherals such as the BERI programmable interrupt
  control, C-language simulations exposing UNIX devices within the
  simulation (e.g., disk images as SD cards), and the control/debugging tool
  berictl.  We include our FPGA projects for synthesis on the DE4, so this
  release is usable for both Bluespec software simulation and synthesis on
  FPGA.
