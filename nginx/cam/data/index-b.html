<h1>
  CTSRD Open Data
</h1>
<br clear=all>

<p>
In order to better support reproducible scientific results in all of our
projects and publications, the CTSRD project open sources hardware (e.g.,
the <a href="../cheri/">CHERI Processor</a>) and software (e.g., the <a
href="../cheri/cheribsd.html">CheriBSD operating system</a>, <a
href="../soaap">SOAAP software analysis system</a>, and <a
href="../tesla/">TESLA assertion system</a>) designs.
We currently are preparing to release data sets from our papers, and hope to
have this information online in late 2016.

  <li><p>IEEE Micro Magazine September/October 2016 - <b>Fast
    Protection-Domain Crossing in the CHERI Capability-System Architecture</b>
    </p>

    <p>This paper explores architectural aspects of CheriBSD's
      hardware-software object-capability model.
      It relies on our open-source <a href="../cheri/">CHERI processor
      prototype</a>, <a href="../cheri/llvm.html">CHERI Clang/LLVM
      compiler</a>, and <a href="../cheri/cheribsd.html">CheriBSD operating
      system</a>.</p>

    <p>Data sets from the paper:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Figure 3: end-to-end domain-switch time in cycles for ISA
        variations</li>
      <li>Figure 4: architectural and microarchitectural costs vs. payload
        size for inter-compartment communication</li>
      <li>Figure 5: comparison of library-compartmentalisation overhead as
        data file size grows</li>
    </ul>
