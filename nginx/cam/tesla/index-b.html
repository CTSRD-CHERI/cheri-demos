<h1 class="title">Temporally Enhanced Security Logic Assertions (TESLA)</h1><p>
TESLA builds on our experiences developing the TrustedBSD MAC Framework
and Capsicum: our most critical security properties are frequently safety
(temporal) properties rather than static invariants.
Current tools for testing temporal properties are largely static, and unable
to work effectively on extremely large C-language software bases, such as
multi-million lines-of-code operating system kernels and web browsers.
TESLA borrows ideas from model checking, applying them in a dynamic context
using compiler-assisted instrumentation to continuously validate temporal
security assertions during software execution.
We have implemented a prototype of TESLA based on clang/LLVM AST transforms,
which is able to test both explicit automata against C implementations (such
as protocol state machines in the kernel and OpenSSL) and inline assertions
checking for missing access control checks in OS logic.

<p><b>Further work on TESLA will take place in the context of the <a
  href="../../cadets/">CADETS</a>, a successor DARPA-sponsored project
  investigating program analysis and transformation in support of distributed
  security tracing.</b></p>
