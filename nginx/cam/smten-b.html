<h1>
  Enhancing the Satisfiability Modulo Theories Experience (Smten)
</h1>
<br clear=all>

<p>
Development of tools for computer aided verification has greatly benefited
from Satisfiability Module Theories (SMT) technologies; instead of writing an
ad-hoc reasoning engine, tool developers translate their problem into SMT
queries which solvers can efficiently solve. In practice, translating
a problem into effective SMT queries is a tedious, error-prone, and
non-trivial task. Smten is a unified language for general-purpose
functional programming and SMT query orchestration whose goal is to greatly
simplify the development of practical SMT-based tools for computer aided
verification.
</p>

<p>
We are developing an open-source implementation of the Smten language as a
plugin to the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc">Glasgow Haskell
    Compiler</a> which supports the full syntax of the <a
    href="http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/">Haskell</a>
functional programming language. Our implementation currently supports SMT
solvers <a href="http://yices.csl.sri.com/">Yices1</a>, <a
    href="http://yices.csl.sri.com/download-yices2.shtml">Yices2</a>,
    <a href="http://z3.codeplex.com">Z3</a>, and <a
    href="http://sites.google.com/site/stpfastprover">STP</a>. The source code
and additional documentation for Smten is available on github
<a href="http://www.github.com/ruhler/smten">here</a>.

Hampi: String Constraint Solver
</dt>

<dd>
<p>
As an illustration of the conciseness and flexibility of design in
Smten, we reimplemented the string constraint
solver <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/akiezun/hampi">HAMPI</a>. The
resulting SHAMPI tool is of comparable performance at 20x fewer lines
of code, and it has the ability to completely change the low-level
theories and SMT solvers used in solving the string constraints.
See <a href="#smten_cav13">below</a> for results of this work as presented
at CAV2013. The source code for SHAMPI is available on github 
<a href="http://www.github.com/ruhler/shampi">here</a>.

Simulation Verification of Bluespec SystemVerilog Designs
</dt>

<dd>
<p>
Bluespec StystemVerilog is a hardware description language centered
around the notion of guarded atomic actions (GAAs) to improve hardware
design modularity and reuse. GAAs have a natural correspondence to
term rewrite systems, which have seen significant use in formal
analysis. Despite this, there has been relatively limited progress in
leveraging Bluespec's semantic model for formal analysis. We are
implementing a variation of a <a href="#memocode11">recently proposed
GAA-based simulation technique</a> that mechanically extracts an architectural
view from a microarchitectural design given a predicate representing that
view. This can be used to quickly extract a specification-level
representation of a design which can be much more easily checked,
either by hand or mechanically. We are in the process of scaling up
the performance to provide a fast abstraction of the
<a href="cheri/">CHERI</a> processor.</p>
