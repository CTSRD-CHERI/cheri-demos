<h1>
  CHERI archival releases
</h1>

<p>
<i>This is an archival version of the original CHERI early adopters'
  website which provides access to 2013 early releases to MIT/LL, MITRE, and
  other CRASH/MRC-programme users.
  The current website can be found <a href="../">here</a>.</i>
</p>

<p>
This website provides information, hardware designs, and software for
early-access users of the <a href="../cheri.html">CHERI microprocessor</a>.
This includes architecture, platform reference, and user guides, FPGA bitfiles
to be flashed onto development boards, and software images necessary to
exercise and experiment with the CHERI architecture.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.csl.sri.com">SRI International</a> and the <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</a> are able to
provide only limited support for externel CHERI deployment.
However, we encourage you to contact us if any issues are encountered, and we
will work to support a growing user community as resources permit.
</p>

<h2>WARNING</h2>

<p>
CHERI and its software are highly experimental; early adopters are warned that
correct operation is unlikely (despite the best of intentions by its
developers).
Further, CHERI units may interfere with other devices on the network, and have
done so in the past, due to use of experimental network features, device
driver bugs, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Users may wish to employ caution when deploying CHERI devices in production
network environments, and will ideally place them behind existing firewalls.
It is also possible (and in fact, fairly easy) to cause permanent damage to
FPGA development boards -- e.g., by damaging the on-board flash (etc), which
is an expensive scenario best avoided.
