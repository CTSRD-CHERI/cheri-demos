<dt>December 2022</dt>
<dd><p>Welcome to the Fall 2022 release of the CheriBSD operating system.  As
  well as a general update of the baseline FreeBSD OS from which CheriBSD is
  derived, we have introduced several new research components which will be of
  interest to the CHERI and CheriBSD community:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Memory-safe adaptation of Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) and Panfrost
    device driver, which enable a Morello-based desktop system using on-board
    GPU and HDMI. These drivers may be used with hybrid or pure-capability
    kernels.</li>

  <li>An initial set of graphics and desktop CheriABI software packages such
    as Wayland and portions of KDE to get you up and running with a
    memory-safe desktop environment. These components remain under active
    development, and we anticipate continuing package updates after the
    CheriBSD release.</li>

  <li>An early research prototype of Library Compartmentalization
    (<a href="https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheripedia/wiki/Library-based-Compartmentalisation">GitHub
    page</a>), which implements an alternative run-time linker running shared
    objects in libraries. This implementation is very much a work-in-progress,
    and is provided to enable research at other collaborator institutions
    needing easy access to the prototype. It is neither complete nor intended
    to be secure.</li>

  <li>Improved pluggability of experimental heap temporal memory-safety
    support, which is not yet merged into the main development branch, but
    will now be easier to use by downloading an alternative kernel and heap
    allocator libraries provided by Microsoft.</li>

  <li>Support for Arm’s Morello GDB in CheriBSD, which provides generally
    improved debugging support including Morello code disassembly. We have
    also added support for memory tag access from the debugger on live targets
    as well as core dumps.</li>

  <li>Alpha support for ZFS file systems including support for boot
    environments.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>While CheriBSD is by definition an experimental research operating
    system, the above features – other than GDB improvements – are not yet
    considered to be mature. They are being made available as an early release
    to facilitate collaboration, but will not be suitable for a general
    Morello audience until the following release.</p>

  <p>As with previous releases, the default CheriBSD kernel on Morello ships
    with debugging features enabled, which should be disabled by booting a
    non-debug kernel before any performance benchmarking is performed.</p>
</dd>

<dt>May 2022</dt>
<dd><p>The CHERI Project is pleased to announce our Getting Started release of
  CheriBSD (22.05).  The Getting Started release has been timed to coincide
  with the May 2022 availability of Arm's CHERI-enabled Morello Board
  prototype.</p>

  <p>CheriBSD is an adaptation of FreeBSD for CHERI, providing an experimental
  operating system with a rich use of the Morello prototype architecture’s
  features. It is intended to be a platform for general research, development,
  evaluation, and demonstration for secure, memory-safe CHERI-enabled systems.
  CheriBSD provides spatial and referential memory safety to all software
  running in userspace and, optionally, the entire operating system kernel.
  Future releases will also implement CHERI-based temporal memory safety and
  software compartmentalization features.</p>

  <p>The Getting Started release is delivered as an installable image which
  needs to be downloaded, written to a USB storage device, and installed on
  the Morello Board. Read the <a href="https://ctsrd-cheri.github.io/cheribsd-getting-started/">Getting
  Started with CheriBSD</a> guide to learn more how to obtain a copy of the
  latest release and install it. The guide also includes information on what
  third-party software is available for CheriBSD and Morello.</p>

  <p>The best way to contact CheriBSD developers, CHERI researchers, and other
  CheriBSD users is via the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/cheri-slack.html">CHERI-CPU
  Slack</a>, which includes a #cheribsd channel.</p>

  <p>We gratefully acknowledge our sponsors and supporters including UKRI,
  DARPA, Arm, Google, Microsoft, and others. We offer many thanks to the
  complete CHERI hardware, software, and formal teams at SRI International and
  the University of Cambridge, without whom this work would never have taken
  place.</p>

  <p>CheriBSD/Morello is a Digital Security by Design (DSbD) technology. This
  work was supported in part by the UK Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund
  (ISCF) and Innovate UK project Digital Security by Design (DSbD) Technology
  Platform Prototype, 105694.</p>
